Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy. ","Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time. ","If you dont design your own life plan, chances are youll fall into someone elses plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much. ","Expect problems and eat them for breakfast. ","If youre going through hell, keep going. ","You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream. ","A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others. ","After a storm comes a calm. ","The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential... these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence. ","Even if you fall on your face, youre still moving forward. ","With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts. ","I dont believe you have to be better than everybody else. I believe you have to be better than you ever thought you could be. ","Be miserable. Or motivate yourself. Whatever has to be done, its always your choice. ","Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence. ","You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else. ","Learn from the past, set vivid, detailed goals for the future, and live in the only moment of time over which you have any control: now. ","The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best. ","If you can dream it, you can do it. ","Do you want to know who you are? Dont ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you. ","Always continue the climb. It is possible for you to do whatever you choose, if you first get to know who you are and are willing to work with a power that is greater than ourselves to do it. ","I know where Im going and I know the truth, and I dont have to be what you want me to be. Im free to be what I want. ","Never, never, never give up. ","By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail. ","In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can. ","Either you run the day or the day runs you. ","We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. Its never your fault. But its always your fault, because if you wanted to change youre the one who has got to change. ","Things do not happen. Things are made to happen. ","What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals. ","Who seeks shall find. ","Be Impeccable With Your Word. Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love. ","Know or listen to those who know. ","Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does. ","The secret of getting ahead is getting started. ","Well done is better than well said. ","Your talent is Gods gift to you. What you do with it is your gift back to God. ","The more man meditates upon good thoughts, the better will be his world and the world at large. ","Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. ","Learning is the beginning of wealth. Learning is the beginning of health. Learning is the beginning of spirituality. Searching and learning is where the miracle process all begins. ","Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better. ","If you dont like how things are, change it! Youre not a tree. ","If you want to conquer fear, dont sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy. ","Quality is not an act, it is a habit. ","Be gentle to all and stern with yourself. ","Id rather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed. ","True happiness involves the full use of ones power and talents. ","There is always room at the top. ","If you want to succeed you should strike out on new paths, rather than travel the worn paths of accepted success. ","Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines. ","Opportunity does not knock, it presents itself when you beat down the door. ","Follow your dreams, work hard, practice and persevere. Make sure you eat a variety of foods, get plenty of exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle. ","Ive worked too hard and too long to let anything stand in the way of my goals. I will not let my teammates down and I will not let myself down. ","The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. ","If you ask me what I came into this life to do, I will tell you: I came to live out loud. ","Always desire to learn something useful. ","Set your sights high, the higher the better. Expect the most wonderful things to happen, not in the future but right now. Realize that nothing is too good. Allow absolutely nothing to hamper you or hold you up in any way. ","Infuse your life with action. Dont wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth. ","What you do today can improve all your tomorrows. ","Do something wonderful, people may imitate it. ","Without hard work, nothing grows but weeds. ","A goal is a dream with a deadline. ","Do your work with your whole heart, and you will succeed - theres so little competition. ","Its always too early to quit. ","Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible. ","The first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself. ","Never complain and never explain. ","You cant build a reputation on what you are going to do. ","The hardships that I encountered in the past will help me succeed in the future. ","The most effective way to do it, is to do it. ","You need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals. ","When you fail you learn from the mistakes you made and it motivates you to work even harder. ","You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand. ","What is called genius is the abundance of life and health. ","You can never quit. Winners never quit, and quitters never win. ","Big shots are only little shots who keep shooting. ","Perseverance is failing 19 times and succeeding the 20th. ","Set your goals high, and dont stop till you get there. ","Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot; but make it hot by striking. ","Leap, and the net will appear. ","To know oneself, one should assert oneself. ","Motivation is the art of getting people to do what you want them to do because they want to do it. ","Go for it now. The future is promised to no one. ","Begin to be now what you will be hereafter. ","Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star. ","I learned that we can do anything, but we cant do everything... at least not at the same time. So think of your priorities not in terms of what activities you do, but when you do them. Timing is everything. ","Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other. ","Only the educated are free. ","If you fell down yesterday, stand up today. ","Crave for a thing, you will get it. Renounce the craving, the object will follow you by itself. ","To be wholly devoted to some intellectual exercise is to have succeeded in life. ","Small deeds done are better than great deeds planned. ","Ive found that luck is quite predictable. If you want more luck, take more chances. Be more active. Show up more often. ","One finds limits by pushing them. ","Fear cannot be without hope nor hope without fear. ","In motivating people, youve got to engage their minds and their hearts. I motivate people, I hope, by example - and perhaps by excitement, by having productive ideas to make others feel involved. ","The ultimate aim of the ego is not to see something, but to be something. ","I really believe that everyone has a talent, ability, or skill that he can mine to support himself and to succeed in life. ","Go big or go home. Because its true. What do you have to lose? ","Wherever you are - be all there. ","I can, therefore I am. ","You cant wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club. ","To be a good loser is to learn how to win. ","The will to succeed is important, but whats more important is the will to prepare. ","Poverty was the greatest motivating factor in my life. ","You cant expect to hit the jackpot if you dont put a few nickels in the machine. ","No matter how many goals you have achieved, you must set your sights on a higher one. ","The wise does at once what the fool does at last. ","If youve got a talent, protect it. ","You just cant beat the person who never gives up. ","If you think you can do it, you can. ","Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work. ","The weeds keep multiplying in our garden, which is our mind ruled by fear. Rip them out and call them by name. ","We make the world we live in and shape our own environment. ","Never give in and never give up. ","Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me. ","There is nothing deep down inside us except what we have put there ourselves. ","Follow your inner moonlight; dont hide the madness. ","Be thine own palace, or the worlds thy jail. ","I was motivated to be different in part because I was different. ","Dont watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going. ","The dog that trots about finds a bone. ","Dont fight the problem, decide it. ","Do not weep; do not wax indignant. Understand. ","The people who influence you are the people who believe in you. ","To begin, begin. ","One may miss the mark by aiming too high as too low. ","Press forward. Do not stop, do not linger in your journey, but strive for the mark set before you. ","The more we do, the more we can do. ","You never know what motivates you. ","Do not wait; the time will never be just right. Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along. ","Never retreat. Never explain. Get it done and let them howl. ","You create your opportunities by asking for them. ","Your heaviest artillery will be your will to live. Keep that big gun going. ","He conquers who endures. ","One way to keep momentum going is to have constantly greater goals. ","Deserve your dream. ","Step by step and the thing is done. ","One of the things that I did before I ran for president is I was a professional speaker. Not a motivational speaker - an inspirational speaker. Motivation comes from within. You have to be inspired. Thats what I do. I inspire people, I inspire the public, I inspire my staff. I inspired the organizations I took over to want to succeed. ","Oh, I would love to be a motivational speaker. I have pulled myself out of a million potholes, and I can see the potholes ahead of me. That doesnt mean that I could always do that so perfectly for my own life. I totally fall in potholes. ","Ive always thought of acting as more of an exercise in empathy, which is not to be confused with sympathy. Youre trying to get inside a certain emotional reality or motivational reality and try to figure out what thats about so you can represent it. ","Success is the only motivational factor that a boy with character needs. ","People always accuse me of being motivational in a way, like it was a bad thing, but thats just how I was raised. My mom raised me in a positive environment, with lots of love in my heart, and that reflects in my music. ","I like to put on hardcore when I have to clean my apartment, which I hate to do, but its motivational. I like old heavy metal when Im outside working on my car. Music has definite functions for me. ","Giving back, doing motivational speeches and stuff like that, thats always made me feel good. If you repeatedly go out there, and you are the change that you want to see, then thats what you are. ","Im a motivational speaker. ","As long as Im not selling out the people that ride or die with me, Im glad Im not an MC. Im a motivational speaker. Im not that rapper dude. ","Im thrilled to continue my partnership with U by Kotex for Generation Know while helping to empower girls. Ive always been a motivational resource for my younger sisters and hope I can positively impact and inspire other young girls too. ","Typically, if you reward something, you get more of it. You punish something, you get less of it. And our businesses have been built for the last 150 years very much on that kind of motivational scheme. ","Im going to write a book, continue acting, continue motivational speaking and just share with people who I am and what Ive learned in my second chance of life and pass it on to people in their first chance of life. ","Religious speech is extreme, emotional, and motivational. It is anti-literal, relying on metaphor, allusion, and other rhetorical devices, and it assumes knowledge within a community of believers. ","I like motivational books, because I like the go-getting American spirit - your destiny is in your own hands, life is what you make it, dont accept your limitations, jump before youre pushed, leap before you look. ","I went to a motivational training course once, a course of self-discovery, and I found out after a week that my fear - it was not a fear of not being accepted - was a very violent fear of failure. ","One day, I got so disgusted that I sat down and wrote a list called Justins list of things to do before he kicks the bucket. I wrote it for myself and shortened it to Justins Bucket List. It was there on the wall, not as a story idea but as a motivational tool for myself, which actually ended up working pretty well. ","I believe that any type of education can be great, but an education about ourselves can create something wonderful. I am a comedian, but people have called me a motivational speaker. I dont really consider myself that at all. ","Happiness often sneaks in through a door you didnt know you left open. ","Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions. ","Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be. ","Be happy with what you have and are, be generous with both, and you wont have to hunt for happiness. ","I am determined to be cheerful and happy in whatever situation I may find myself. For I have learned that the greater part of our misery or unhappiness is determined not by our circumstance but by our disposition. ","Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony. ","Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life. ","Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go. ","If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion. ","A table, a chair, a bowl of fruit and a violin; what else does a man need to be happy? ","The purpose of our lives is to be happy. ","Our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us, but is always the result of a good conscience, good health, occupation, and freedom in all just pursuits. ","Dont wait around for other people to be happy for you. Any happiness you get youve got to make yourself. ","True happiness comes from the joy of deeds well done, the zest of creating things new. ","The first recipe for happiness is: avoid too lengthy meditation on the past. ","Just do what must be done. This may not be happiness, but it is greatness. ","The Constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself. ","It is not how much we have, but how much we enjoy, that makes happiness. ","Achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life, and that happiness, not pain or mindless self-indulgence, is the proof of your moral integrity, since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values. ","There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will. ","Happiness depends upon ourselves. ","Everything has its wonders, even darkness and silence, and I learn, whatever state I may be in, therein to be content. ","Happiness doesnt depend on any external conditions, it is governed by our mental attitude. ","Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls. ","We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ","Future. That period of time in which our affairs prosper, our friends are true and our happiness is assured. ","Happiness is not a goal; it is a by-product. ","Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know. ","There are people who can do all fine and heroic things but one - keep from telling their happiness to the unhappy. ","True happiness... is not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a worthy purpose. ","But what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads? ","There is only one happiness in this life, to love and be loved. ","The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature. ","It is neither wealth nor splendor; but tranquility and occupation which give you happiness. ","Love is trembling happiness. ","If your happiness depends on what somebody else does, I guess you do have a problem. ","Action may not always bring happiness; but there is no happiness without action. ","Money cant buy happiness, but it can make you awfully comfortable while youre being miserable. ","Happiness is like a kiss. You must share it to enjoy it. ","Happiness is nothing more than good health and a bad memory. ","Happiness is not a matter of intensity but of balance, order, rhythm and harmony. ","Happiness is the only good. The time to be happy is now. The place to be happy is here. The way to be happy is to make others so. ","Happiness makes up in height for what it lacks in length. ","To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness. ","If you want to be happy, be. ","An effort made for the happiness of others lifts above ourselves. ","In order to have great happiness you have to have great pain and unhappiness - otherwise how would you know when youre happy? ","True happiness is... to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future. ","Your successes and happiness are forgiven you only if you generously consent to share them. ","You can be happy where you are. ","Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. ","The two enemies of human happiness are pain and boredom. ","Happy is the man who has broken the chains which hurt the mind, and has given up worrying once and for all. ","Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of ones values. ","The person born with a talent they are meant to use will find their greatest happiness in using it. ","Happiness is an inside job. ","What we call the secret of happiness is no more a secret than our willingness to choose life. ","To forget oneself is to be happy. ","You know its love when all you want is that person to be happy, even if youre not part of their happiness. ","Happiness is found in doing, not merely possessing. ","A sure way to lose happiness, I found, is to want it at the expense of everything else. ","Happiness... consists in giving, and in serving others. ","Every gift from a friend is a wish for your happiness. ","Anything youre good at contributes to happiness. ","Everyone chases after happiness, not noticing that happiness is right at their heels. ","The art of being happy lies in the power of extracting happiness from common things. ","You must try to generate happiness within yourself. If you arent happy in one place, chances are you wont be happy anyplace. ","There is something curiously boring about somebody elses happiness. ","A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of. ","I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy. ","The greatest of follies is to sacrifice health for any other kind of happiness. ","Nothing brings me more happiness than trying to help the most vulnerable people in society. It is a goal and an essential part of my life - a kind of destiny. Whoever is in distress can call on me. I will come running wherever they are. ","Do not speak of your happiness to one less fortunate than yourself. ","All happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love. ","Research has shown that the best way to be happy is to make each day happy. ","Happiness is a continuation of happenings which are not resisted. ","All who joy would win must share it. Happiness was born a Twin. ","Never mind your happiness; do your duty. ","Man needs, for his happiness, not only the enjoyment of this or that, but hope and enterprise and change. ","Happiness is neither without us nor within us. It is in God, both without us and within us. ","Now and then its good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy. ","Dont walk in front of me, I may not follow. Dont walk behind me, I may not lead. There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved. ","Happiness exists on earth, and it is won through prudent exercise of reason, knowledge of the harmony of the universe, and constant practice of generosity. ","Happiness depends more on how life strikes you than on what happens. ","Happiness is like those palaces in fairy tales whose gates are guarded by dragons: we must fight in order to conquer it. ","True happiness consists not in the multitude of friends, but in the worth and choice. ","The secret of happiness is to admire without desiring. ","When what we are is what we want to be, thats happiness. ","It is not Gods will merely that we should be happy, but that we should make ourselves happy. ","Happy he who learns to bear what he cannot change. ","Happiness grows at our own firesides, and is not to be picked in strangers gardens. ","Happiness is ideal, it is the work of the imagination. ","Happiness does not lie in happiness, but in the achievement of it. ","Lovers who love truly do not write down their happiness. ","Money cant buy you happiness, but it can buy you a yacht big enough to pull up right alongside it. ","Plenty of people miss their share of happiness, not because they never found it, but because they didnt stop to enjoy it. ","Always leave something to wish for; otherwise you will be miserable from your very happiness. ","Happiness: an agreeable sensation arising from contemplating the misery of another. ","Nothing prevents happiness like the memory of happiness. ","Happiness is having a scratch for every itch. ","Desire nothing, give up all desires and be happy. ","The moments of happiness we enjoy take us by surprise. It is not that we seize them, but that they seize us. ","Happiness is a direction, not a place. ","Happiness is brief. It will not stay. God batters at its sails. ","Happiness comes only when we push our brains and hearts to the farthest reaches of which we are capable. ","If you wait for the perfect moment when all is safe and assured, it may never arrive. Mountains will not be climbed, races won, or lasting happiness achieved. ","The happiness of most people is not ruined by great catastrophes or fatal errors, but by the repetition of slowly destructive little things. ","The happiness of a man in this life does not consist in the absence but in the mastery of his passions. ","The secret of happiness is something to do. ","Happiness is itself a kind of gratitude. ","People let their own hang-ups become the obstacles between them and personal happiness. ","In times of joy, all of us wished we possessed a tail we could wag. ","One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory. ","If you hope for happiness in the world, hope for it from God, and not from the world. ","It is the chiefest point of happiness that a man is willing to be what he is. ","Our happiness depends on wisdom all the way. ","Happiness isnt something you experience; its something you remember. ","Happiness is a virtue, not its reward. ","To describe happiness is to diminish it. ","Its enough to indulge and to be selfish but true happiness is really when you start giving back. ","Happiness includes chiefly the idea of satisfaction after full honest effort. No one can possibly be satisfied and no one can be happy who feels that in some paramount affairs he failed to take up the challenge of life. ","It is not easy to find happiness in ourselves, and it is not possible to find it elsewhere. ","Happiness is like a cloud, if you stare at it long enough, it evaporates. ","Happiness is mostly a by-product of doing what makes us feel fulfilled. ","Unquestionably, it is possible to do without happiness; it is done involuntarily by nineteen-twentieths of mankind. ","Its pretty hard to tell what does bring happiness; poverty and wealth have both failed. ","Happiness is a by-product. You cannot pursue it by itself. ","Happiness never lays its finger on its pulse. ","Happiness is the interval between periods of unhappiness. ","Happiness is spiritual, born of truth and love. It is unselfish; therefore it cannot exist alone, but requires all mankind to share it. ","Desire is individual. Happiness is common. ","Happiness is the harvest of a quiet eye. ","Satisfaction of ones curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life. ","There is only one passion, the passion for happiness. ","Life in common among people who love each other is the ideal of happiness. ","To buy happiness is to sell soul. ","Youve got to ask! Asking is, in my opinion, the worlds most powerful - and neglected - secret to success and happiness. ","Happiness seems made to be shared. ","Growth itself contains the germ of happiness. ","Happiness does not consist in self-love. ","There is happiness in duty, although it may not seem so. ","It is only to the happy that tears are a luxury. ","Only man clogs his happiness with care, destroying what is with thoughts of what may be. ","Happiness is composed of misfortunes avoided. ","Most of us believe in trying to make other people happy only if they can be happy in ways which we approve. ","Joys divided are increased. ","Love is the most terrible, and also the most generous of the passions; it is the only one which includes in its dreams the happiness of someone else. ","To attain happiness in another world we need only to believe something, while to secure it in this world we must do something. ","The right to happiness is fundamental. ","We possess only the happiness we are able to understand. ","We are no longer happy so soon as we wish to be happier. ","How easy to be amiable in the midst of happiness and success. ","Happiness must be cultivated. It is like character. It is not a thing to be safely let alone for a moment, or it will run to weeds. ","Life everlasting in a state of happiness is the greatest desire of all men. ","If you have easy self-contentment, you might have a very, very cheap source of happiness. ","The happiness which is lacking makes one think even the happiness one has unbearable. ","So long as we can lose any happiness, we possess some. ","The secret of happiness is to admire without desiring. And that is not happiness. ","Happiness is hard to recall. Its just a glow. ","Happiness will come from materialism, not from meaning. ","The action is best that secures the greatest happiness for the greatest number. ","There is no worse sorrow than remembering happiness in the day of sorrow. ","Affection is responsible for nine-tenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our lives. ","Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present. ","Happiness resides not in possessions, and not in gold, happiness dwells in the soul. ","Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. ","You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life. ","Your success and happiness lies in you. Resolve to keep happy, and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties. ","To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to ones family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control ones own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him. ","The U. S. Constitution doesnt guarantee happiness, only the pursuit of it. You have to catch up with it yourself. ","It is very important to generate a good attitude, a good heart, as much as possible. From this, happiness in both the short term and the long term for both yourself and others will come. ","God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there. There is no such thing. ","Love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own. ","Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness. ","Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude. ","Three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for. ","Today I choose life. Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices - today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it. ","Money has never made man happy, nor will it, there is nothing in its nature to produce happiness. The more of it one has the more one wants. ","The true secret of happiness lies in taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life. ","Independence is happiness. ","Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own... Jealousy is a disease, love is a healthy condition. The immature mind often mistakes one for the other, or assumes that the greater the love, the greater the jealousy.

A very wholesome and comfortable doctrine, and to which we have but one objection, namely, that it is not true. ","Ive gotten to a point, where I realize that happiness doesnt come from the outside. ","Happiness is nothing but temporary moments here and there - and I love those. But I would be bored out of my mind if I were happy all the time.

","The mindset of chasing that next #1 record doesnt exist for me anymore. Its more about being a well-rounded entertainer than being a pop artist.

But I am interested in manifestations of love beyond the traditional romantic notion.

You have to find the lemonade. You have to find the silver lining in the middle of everything that happens in life. ","The arts are weapons of understanding and weapons of happiness. ","I love being on stage. Im completely, totally relaxed. Its the only time in my life when I know where I am and whats coming next. The other Robert Powell is probably fairly melancholic. Lets just say happiness isnt my default position. There are dark parts. Im very good at it. I frighten people sometimes. ","I truly am living out what true joy and happiness means. ","The bias against introversion leads to a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness. ","Shall I give you my recipe for happiness? I find everything useful and nothing indispensable. I find everything wonderful and nothing miraculous. I reverence the body. I avoid first causes like the plague. ","I have a talent for happiness. I look with the eyes of a painter, and I see beauty. ","I just hope I can spread some of the happiness thats been coming my way. ","Many a happiness in life, as many a disaster, can be due to chance, but the peace within us can never be governed by chance. ","Happiness is rarely absent; it is we that know not of its presence. ","Because economics is all about optimising, doing the best you can with what you have - its usually the first place you should look for answers if you want to maximise your happiness. ","Economists typically think that your happiness goes up as you get more money, but the more you have, the less each additional dollar matters. This means that you value money most in times when you have less income and more expenses. ","SuperBetter is fundamentally about a mind shift. Its about claiming your power to be in charge of how you spend your time and energy, and focusing it on the things that matter the most to you. Focusing on things that will bring real happiness, real well-being. "};
