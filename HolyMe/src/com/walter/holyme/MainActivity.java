It is the gift of God to man the moment he sees he is unworthy of Gods favor.","A man does not get grace till he comes down to the ground, till he sees he needs grace. When a man stoops to the dust and acknowledges that he needs mercy, then it is that the Lord will give him grace.","If you are ready to partake of grace you have not to atone for your sins--you have merely to accept of the atonement.

He gets along without it","Thanks be to God, there is hope to-day this very hour you can choose Him and serve Him.","A man can counterfeit love, he can counterfeit faith, he can counterfeit hope and all the other graces, but it is very difficult to counterfeit humility.","The law stops every mans mouth. God will have a man humble himself down on his face before Him, with not a word to say for himself.

America is full of them. Whatever you love more than God is your idol.","A rule I have had for years is to treat the Lord Jesus Christ as a personal friend. His is not a creed, a mere doctrine, but it is He Himself we have.","Never think that Jesus commanded a trifle, nor dare to trifle with anything He has commanded.","Happiness is caused by things that happen around me, and circumstances will mar it but joy flows right on through trouble joy flows on through the dark joy flows in the night as well as in the day joy flows all through persecution and opposition.","The Lord gives his people perpetual joy when they walk in obedience to him.","If a man gets drunk and goes out and breaks his leg so that it must be amputated, God will forgive him if he asks it, but he will have to hop around on one leg all his life.","Preparation for old age should begin not later than ones teens. A life which is empty of purpose until 65 will not suddenly become filled on retirement.","Where I was born and where and how I have lived is unimportant. It is what I have done with where I have been that should be of interest.","Let God have your life He can do more with it than you can.","The world does not understand theology or dogma, but it understands love and sympathy.","If we have got the true love of God shed abroad in our hearts, we will show it in our lives. We will not have to go up and down the earth proclaiming it. We will show it in everything we say or do.","When we find a man meditating on the words of God, my friends, that man is full of boldness and is successful.","Now, as old Dr. Bonner, of Glasgow, said, The Lord didnt show Joshua how to use the sword, but He told him how he should meditate on the Lord day and night, and then he would have good success.","The impression that a praying mother leaves upon her children is life-long.

An opaque one shall surely cause us to shrink back intuitively from God.","Many times men criticize us when we actually are following the Lord. Outside praise or criticism is inconsequential but the testimony of our quickened conscience is momentous.","Naturally there are many reasons for not possessing greater faith, but the gravest of these is probably an evil conscience.

It is imperative that we determine for ourselves whether we have been delivered from the base and the ignoble.","Christians should not be content merely with knowing mentally the doctrine of the Holy Spirit as given in the Bible they also need to know Him experimentally.","Eternal life means more than mere future blessing to be enjoyed by believers it is equally a kind of spiritual ability.","Our old history ends with the cross our new history begins with the resurrection.","A person who wholly follows the Lord is one who believes that the promises of God are trustworthy, that He is with His people, and that they are well able to overcome.","We have received life, yet this life and the head are inseparable.
