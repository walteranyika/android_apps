    			String[] quote={"Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead. ","Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage. ","Friends can help each other. A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to feel. Or, not feel. Whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them. Thats what real love amounts to - letting a person be what he really is. ","Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye. ","Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies. ","I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear. ","Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable. ","Immature love says: I love you because I need you. Mature love says I need you because I love you. ","Where there is love there is life. ","Affection is responsible for nine-tenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our lives. ","A loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge. ","Were born alone, we live alone, we die alone. Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that were not alone. ","I have found the paradox, that if you love until it hurts, there can be no more hurt, only more love. ","Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. ","Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up. ","A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous. ","Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love. ","A man reserves his true and deepest love not for the species of woman in whose company he finds himself electrified and enkindled, but for that one in whose company he may feel tenderly drowsy. ","Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do... but how much love we put in that action. ","A flower cannot blossom without sunshine, and man cannot live without love. ","Can miles truly separate you from friends... If you want to be with someone you love, arent you already there? ","A man is already halfway in love with any woman who listens to him. ","A woman knows the face of the man she loves as a sailor knows the open sea. ","Do all things with love. ","We love life, not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving. ","Love is a force more formidable than any other. It is invisible - it cannot be seen or measured, yet it is powerful enough to transform you in a moment, and offer you more joy than any material possession could. ","Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity. ","The first duty of love is to listen. ","I was born with an enormous need for affection, and a terrible need to give it. ","Love yourself first and everything else falls into line. You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world. ","Love is a better teacher than duty. ","Love is like war: easy to begin but very hard to stop. ","The hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread. ","What we have once enjoyed we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us. ","Love is always bestowed as a gift - freely, willingly and without expectation. We dont love to be loved; we love to love. ","Love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place. ","Absence diminishes mediocre passions and increases great ones, as the wind extinguishes candles and fans fires. ","Love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own. ","At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. ","The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. ","Love is life. And if you miss love, you miss life. ","Come live in my heart, and pay no rent. ","The best proof of love is trust. ","Love isnt something you find. Love is something that finds you. ","Faith makes all things possible... love makes all things easy. ","As soon go kindle fire with snow, as seek to quench the fire of love with words. ","Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit. ","To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance. ","Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship - never. ","Love is a game that two can play and both win. ","We loved with a love that was more than love. ","Love can sometimes be magic. But magic can sometimes... just be an illusion. ","Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can grow, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky. ","The art of love is largely the art of persistence. ","The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved; loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves. ","A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love. ","True love is like ghosts, which everyone talks about and few have seen. ","I like not only to be loved, but also to be told I am loved. ","A part of kindness consists in loving people more than they deserve. ","We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love. ","Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs. ","Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired. ","Who, being loved, is poor? ","Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction. ","A very small degree of hope is sufficient to cause the birth of love. ","First love is only a little foolishness and a lot of curiosity. ","Love is the flower youve got to let grow. ","The giving of love is an education in itself. ","Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. ","Love is of all passions the strongest, for it attacks simultaneously the head, the heart and the senses. ","The way to love anything is to realize that it may be lost. ","A loving heart is the truest wisdom. ","A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. ","All my life, my heart has yearned for a thing I cannot name. ","Everything is clearer when youre in love. ","I can live without money, but I cannot live without love. ","Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence. ","You never lose by loving. You always lose by holding back. ","We need 4 hugs a day for survival. We need 8 hugs a day for maintenance. We need 12 hugs a day for growth. ","Dont brood. Get on with living and loving. You dont have forever. ","All mankind love a lover. ","The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden, a dim twilight, and a fountain singing to it. You and you alone make me feel that I am alive. Other men it is said have seen angels, but I have seen thee and thou art enough. ","Someday, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love, and then, for a second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire. ","Love is a friendship set to music. ","Love possesses not nor will it be possessed, for love is sufficient unto love. ","Love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is done well. ","The one thing we can never get enough of is love. And the one thing we never give enough is love. ","Love... it surrounds every being and extends slowly to embrace all that shall be. ","For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love. ","If you would be loved, love, and be loveable. ","There is no remedy for love but to love more. ","To say I love you one must first be able to say the I. ","The moment you have in your heart this extraordinary thing called love and feel the depth, the delight, the ecstasy of it, you will discover that for you the world is transformed. ","One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving. ","All love shifts and changes. I dont know if you can be wholeheartedly in love all the time. ","Love is the only reality and it is not a mere sentiment. It is the ultimate truth that lies at the heart of creation. ","You will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love. ","Love is the beauty of the soul. ","If you wish to be loved, show more of your faults than your virtues. ","I was about half in love with her by the time we sat down. Thats the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty... you fall half in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are. ","Love does not dominate; it cultivates. ","Only do what your heart tells you. ","Love is the joy of the good, the wonder of the wise, the amazement of the Gods. ","I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death. ","I love that feeling of being in love, the effect of having butterflies when you wake up in the morning. That is special. ","The more one judges, the less one loves. ","To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead. ","Love knows not distance; it hath no continent; its eyes are for the stars. ","Before I met my husband, Id never fallen in love. Id stepped in it a few times. ","The love we give away is the only love we keep. ","It is sad not to love, but it is much sadder not to be able to love. ","Love is a gross exaggeration of the difference between one person and everybody else. ","What love weve given, well have forever. What love we fail to give, will be lost for all eternity. ","Love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by imagination. ","If you want to be loved, be lovable. ","When love is not madness, it is not love. ","Its useless to hold a person to anything he says while hes in love, drunk, or running for office. ","Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within. ","You can give without loving, but you can never love without giving. ","Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence. ","Love is being stupid together. ","Bitterness imprisons life; love releases it. ","Love is when you meet someone who tells you something new about yourself. ","Blessed is the influence of one true, loving human soul on another. ","In love the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two. ","We can only learn to love by loving. ","To love another person is to see the face of God. ","It is difficult to know at what moment love begins; it is less difficult to know that it has begun. ","People think love is an emotion. Love is good sense. ","The only abnormality is the incapacity to love. ","Love is an act of endless forgiveness, a tender look which becomes a habit. ","Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other. ","Life is the flower for which love is the honey. ","Love is supreme and unconditional; like is nice but limited. ","Love is the greatest refreshment in life. ","There is no disguise which can hide love for long where it exists, or simulate it where it does not. ","Lord, grant that I might not so much seek to be loved as to love. ","Absence - that common cure of love. ","Love doesnt make the world go round. Love is what makes the ride worthwhile. ","How absurd and delicious it is to be in love with somebody younger than yourself. Everybody should try it. ","Be of love a little more careful than of anything. ","There is a woman at the begining of all great things. ","Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same. ","The sweetest of all sounds is that of the voice of the woman we love. ","The degree of loving is measured by the degree of giving. ","Gestures, in love, are incomparably more attractive, effective and valuable than words. ","A kiss is a rosy dot over the i of loving. ","If you can learn to love yourself and all the flaws, you can love other people so much better. And that makes you so happy. ","If you wished to be loved, love. ","Tell me who admires and loves you, and I will tell you who you are. ","When we are in love we seem to ourselves quite different from what we were before. ","Love is but the discovery of ourselves in others, and the delight in the recognition. ","Love has no age, no limit; and no death. ","Choose your love, Love your choice. ","Sometimes its a form of love just to talk to somebody that you have nothing in common with and still be fascinated by their presence. ","Love cures people - both the ones who give it and the ones who receive it. ","True love comes quietly, without banners or flashing lights. If you hear bells, get your ears checked. ","Love is my religion - I could die for it. ","Love is the hardest habit to break, and the most difficult to satisfy. ","I believe in the compelling power of love. I do not understand it. I believe it to be the most fragrant blossom of all this thorny existence. ","There is only one kind of love, but there are a thousand imitations. ","The most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire. ","Love is the delusion that one woman differs from another. ","Love in its essence is spiritual fire. ","The way to know life is to love many things. ","To witness two lovers is a spectacle for the gods. ","As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. ","There isnt any formula or method. You learn to love by loving - by paying attention and doing what one thereby discovers has to be done. ","Love takes up where knowledge leaves off. ","Your words are my food, your breath my wine. You are everything to me. ","Love is an emotion experienced by the many and enjoyed by the few. ","Love means to love that which is unlovable; or it is no virtue at all. ","Love means to commit yourself without guarantee. ","Falling in love consists merely in uncorking the imagination and bottling the common sense. ","If you could only love enough, you could be the most powerful person in the world. ","Love is all we have, the only way that each can help the other. ","He is not a lover who does not love forever. ","Love is only a dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the species. ","Friendship is Love without his wings! ","There are never enough I Love Yous. ","Love is when he gives you a piece of your soul, that you never knew was missing. ","Love is the great miracle cure. Loving ourselves works miracles in our lives. ","Love is a sacred reserve of energy; it is like the blood of spiritual evolution. ","Love is suffering. One side always loves more. ","Down on your knees, and thank heaven, fasting, for a good mans love. ","Love is what youve been through with somebody. ","Fortune and love favor the brave. ","Stolen kisses are always sweetest. ","Love looks through a telescope; envy, through a microscope. ","There is no surprise more magical than the surprise of being loved: It is Gods finger on mans shoulder. ","If thou must love me, let it be for naught except for loves sake only. ","Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. ","The richest love is that which submits to the arbitration of time. ","To love abundantly is to live abundantly, and to love forever is to live forever. ","Follow love and it will flee, flee love and it will follow thee. ","We are all born for love. It is the principle of existence, and its only end. ","Love is space and time measured by the heart. ","Each moment of a happy lovers hour is worth an age of dull and common life. ","Love conquers all. ","I dont know that love changes. People change. Circumstances change. ","We may give without loving, but we cannot love without giving. ","You learn to speak by speaking, to study by studying, to run by running, to work by working; in just the same way, you learn to love by loving. ","Love is the poetry of the senses. ","For love is immortality. ","Accustom yourself continually to make many acts of love, for they enkindle and melt the soul. ","The first magic of love is our ignorance that it can ever end. ","Love is the power to see similarity in the dissimilar. ","Loves greatest gift is its ability to make everything it touches sacred. ","The fact is that love is of two kinds, one which commands, and one which obeys. The two are quite distinct, and the passion to which the one gives rise is not the passion of the other. ","Sometimes its hard to be a woman giving all your love to just one man. ","No one has ever loved anyone the way everyone wants to be loved. ","The journey from teaching about love to allowing myself to be loved proved much longer than I realised. ","Love is always being given where it is not required. ","Come live with me and be my love, And we will all the pleasures prove, That valleys, groves, hills, and fields, Woods, or steepy mountain yields. ","If you do not love me I shall not be loved If I do not love you I shall not love. ","Take away love and our earth is a tomb. ","People who throw kisses are hopelessly lazy. ","There is always something left to love. And if you aint learned that, you aint learned nothing. ","To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides. ","Our first and last love is self-love. ","Love is that splendid triggering of human vitality the supreme activity which nature affords anyone for going out of himself toward someone else. ","Let no one who loves be unhappy, even love unreturned has its rainbow. ","When you love a man, he becomes more than a body. His physical limbs expand, and his outline recedes, vanishes. He is rich and sweet and right. He is part of the world, the atmosphere, the blue sky and the blue water. ","Though lovers be lost love shall not. ","Love means not ever having to say youre sorry. ","The quarrels of lovers are the renewal of love. ","Life is like an onion. You peel it off one layer at a time, and sometimes you weep. ","Love is the only gold. ","Love is the child of illusion and the parent of disillusion. ","Say what you will, tis better to be left than never to have been loved. ","The truth is that there is only one terminal dignity - love. And the story of a love is not important - what is important is that one is capable of love. It is perhaps the only glimpse we are permitted of eternity. ","Romantic love is an illusion. Most of us discover this truth at the end of a love affair or else when the sweet emotions of love lead us into marriage and then turn down their flames. ","Love you will find only where you may show yourself weak without provoking strength. ","With our love, we could save the world. ","What the world really needs is more love and less paper work. ","Love is the word used to label the sexual excitement of the young, the habituation of the middle-aged, and the mutual dependence of the old. ","Only love interests me, and I am only in contact with things that revolve around love. ","Love is metaphysical gravity. ","Do you have to have a reason for loving? ","In every living thing there is the desire for love. ","Sympathy constitutes friendship; but in love there is a sort of antipathy, or opposing passion. Each strives to be the other, and both together make up one whole. ","Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold. ","There is more pleasure in loving than in being beloved. ","What is love? It is the morning and the evening star. ","It is easier to love humanity as a whole than to love ones neighbor. ","Love is a mutual self-giving which ends in self-recovery. ","He who loves, flies, runs, and rejoices; he is free and nothing holds him back. ","Woe to the man whose heart has not learned while young to hope, to love - and to put its trust in life. ","Who loves, raves. ","We love because its the only true adventure. ","When youre in love you never really know whether your elation comes from the qualities of the one you love, or if it attributes them to her; whether the light which surrounds her like a halo comes from you, from her, or from the meeting of your sparks. ","If equal affection cannot be, let the more loving be me. ","We dont believe in rheumatism and true love until after the first attack. ","Love is a springtime plant that perfumes everything with its hope, even the ruins to which it clings. ","True love is quiescent, except in the nascent moments of true humility. ","Ultimately love is everything. ","When we lose one we love, our bitterest tears are called forth by the memory of hours when we loved not enough. ","To love for the sake of being loved is human, but to love for the sake of loving is angelic. ","Who so loves believes the impossible. ","Looking back, I have this to regret, that too often when I loved, I did not say so. ","Love is like a faucet, it turns off and on. ","Selfishness is one of the qualities apt to inspire love. ","There is room in the smallest cottage for a happy loving pair. ","Stand by your man. Give him two arms to cling to and something warm to come to. ","Love is an energy which exists of itself. It is its own value. ","There is no limit to the power of loving. ","More than kisses, letters mingle souls. ","When love is at its best, one loves so much that he cannot forget. ","A kiss that is never tasted, is forever and ever wasted. ","Pains of love be sweeter far than all other pleasures are. ","To good and true love fear is forever affixed. ","If it is your time, love will track you down like a cruise missile. ","Who would give a law to lovers? Love is unto itself a higher law. ","Loving others always costs us something and requires effort. And you have to decide to do it on purpose. You cant wait for a feeling to motivate you. ","You dont have to go looking for love when its where you come from. ","Love is blind. ","The cure for all the ills and wrongs, the cares, the sorrows, and the crimes of humanity, all lie in the one word love. It is the divine vitality that everywhere produces and restores life. ","In a full heart there is room for everything, and in an empty heart there is room for nothing. ","In our life there is a single color, as on an artists palette, which provides the meaning of life and art. It is the color of love. ","We love but once, for once only are we perfectly equipped for loving. ","Only divine love bestows the keys of knowledge. ","Love ceases to be a pleasure when it ceases to be a secret. ","Love is loves reward. ","The world is not comprehensible, but it is embraceable: through the embracing of one of its beings. ","All love is vanquished by a succeeding love. ","Love can be unselfish, in the sense of being benevolent and generous, without being selfless. ","Who ever loved that loved not at first sight? ","Love is much nicer to be in than an automobile accident, a tight girdle, a higher tax bracket or a holding pattern over Philadelphia. ","Is it not by love alone that we succeed in penetrating to the very essence of being? ","Love is the magician that pulls man out of his own hat. ","Love is the greatest gift that God has given us. Its free. ","But loves a malady without a cure. ","We perceive when love begins and when it declines by our embarrassment when alone together. ","Self-love is the source of all our other loves. ","I long for the raised voice, the howl of rage or love. ","Love alone could waken love. ","Oh, love will make a dog howl in rhyme. ","My wife, my family, my friends - theyve all taught me things about love and what that emotion really means. In a nutshell, loving someone is about giving, not receiving. ","Love is a hole in the heart. ","No, theres nothing half so sweet in life as loves young dream. ","To enlarge or illustrate this power and effect of love is to set a candle in the sun. ","You dont want to love - your eternal and abnormal craving is to be loved. You arent positive, youre negative. You absorb, absorb, as if you must fill yourself up with love, because youve got a shortage somewhere. ","Bid me to love, and I will give a loving heart to thee. ","I am happier when I love than when I am loved. I adore my husband, my son, my grandchildren, my mother, my dog, and frankly, I dont know if they even like me. But who cares? Loving them is my joy. ","Touch seems to be as essential as sunlight. ","The love which moves the world, according to common Christian belief, is Gods love and the love of God. ","One must not trifle with love. ","The deep joy we take in the company of people with whom we have just recently fallen in love is undisguisable. ","Love has a tide! ","The sweetest noise on earth, a womans tongue; A string which hath no discord. ","Words may be false and full of art; Sighs are the natural language of the heart. ","All love is lost but upon God alone. ","Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. ","Life is a song - sing it. Life is a game - play it. Life is a challenge - meet it. Life is a dream - realize it. Life is a sacrifice - offer it. Life is love - enjoy it. ","We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies. ","Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none. ","When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. ","Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life. ","A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person. ","Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. ","You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. ","I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. ","Motherhood: All love begins and ends there. ","Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into friend. ","When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love. ","My great hope is to laugh as much as I cry; to get my work done and try to love somebody and have the courage to accept the love in return. ","It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages. ","To love beauty is to see light. ","The love of family and the admiration of friends is much more important than wealth and privilege. ","Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another. ","Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart. ","Christmas, my child, is love in action. Every time we love, every time we give, its Christmas. ","Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them humanity cannot survive. ","I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant. ","There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love. ","Never forget the three powerful resources you always have available to you: love, prayer, and forgiveness. ","Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love. ","Dont aim for success if you want it; just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally. ","There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love. ","If music be the food of love, play on. ","All major religious traditions carry basically the same message, that is love, compassion and forgiveness the important thing is they should be part of our daily lives. ","Love begins by taking care of the closest ones - the ones at home. ","Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope. ","I love you when you bow in your mosque, kneel in your temple, pray in your church. For you and I are sons of one religion, and it is the spirit. ","Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule. ","The most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother. ","It is easy to hate and it is difficult to love. This is how the whole scheme of things works. All good things are difficult to achieve; and bad things are very easy to get. ","It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think thats pretty important. ","At the center of non-violence stands the principle of love. ","If you love life, dont waste time, for time is what life is made up of. ","I love people who make me laugh. I honestly think its the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. Its probably the most important thing in a person. ","The foundation stones for a balanced success are honesty, character, integrity, faith, love and loyalty. ","You cant blame gravity for falling in love. ","I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection.

The only way to retain love is to give it away. ","Having a child is surely the most beautifully irrational act that two people in love can commit.

","We always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love - first to their advantage, then to their disadvantage. ","Never make your home in a place. Make a home for yourself inside your own head. Youll find what you need to furnish it - memory, friends you can trust, love of learning, and other such things. That way it will go with you wherever you journey. ","If having a soul means being able to feel love and loyalty and gratitude, then animals are better off than a lot of humans. ","We are never so defensless against suffering as when we love. ","Love is always open arms. If you close your arms about love you will find that you are left holding only yourself. ","Life in abundance comes only through great love. ","No matter what youve done for yourself or for humanity, if you cant look back on having given love and attention to your own family, what have you really accomplished?

","Nothing can bring a real sense of security into the home except true love. ","I have an everyday religion that works for me. Love yourself first, and everything else falls into line.

","Courage is like love; it must have hope for nourishment. ","Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. ","Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here. ","No work or love will flourish out of guilt, fear, or hollowness of heart, just as no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now. ","To love rightly is to love what is orderly and beautiful in an educated and disciplined way. ","May we not succumb to thoughts of violence and revenge today, but rather to thoughts of mercy and compassion. We are to love our enemies that they might be returned to their right minds. ","I often try to tell kids to think about all the people who love you, dont cry over the one person who doesnt. ","Animals are reliable, many full of love, true in their affections, predictable in their actions, grateful and loyal. Difficult standards for people to live up to.

","I love the attention but I dont like too much of it. ","I know youve heard it a thousand times before. But its true - hard work pays off.

","I should like to be able to love my country and still love justice. ","Its tangible, its solid, its beautiful. Its artistic, from my standpoint, and I just love real estate. ","There is no friendship, no love, like that of the parent for the child. ","No one is a friend to his friend who does not love in return. ","Those who have the strength and the love to sit with a dying patient in the silence that goes beyond words will know that this moment is neither frightening nor painful, but a peaceful cessation of the functioning of the body. ","Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned. ","If thou desire the love of God and man, be humble, for the proud heart, as it loves none but itself, is beloved of none but itself. Humility enforces where neither virtue, nor strength, nor reason can prevail. ","Thank you, God, for this good life and forgive us if we do not love it enough.

","Its funny how most people love the dead, once youre dead your made for life. ","I am certainly not an authority on love because there are no authorities on love, just those whove had luck with it and those who havent. ","If I love you, what business is it of yours? ","Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love. ","Honestly, Id love to be remembered as one of the best to ever pick up a mic, but if Im doing my part to lessen some racial tension I feel good about what Im doing. ","It is not love that should be depicted as blind, but self-love. ","We, the People, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which only asks whats in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, ","Where love rules, there is no will to power; and where power predominates, there love is lacking. The one is the shadow of the other. ","Love always creates, it never destroys. In this lies mans only promise. ","We need to teach the next generation of children from day one that they are responsible for their lives. Mankinds greatest gift, also its greatest curse, is that we have free choice. We can make our choices built from love or from fear. ","Whoever loves becomes humble. Those who love have, so to speak, pawned a part of their narcissism. ","I come from that society and there is a common thread, specifically family values - the idea that you do anything for your family, and the unconditional love for ones children. ","Believe in love. Believe in magic. Hell, believe in Santa Clause. Believe in others. Believe in yourself. Believe in your dreams. If you dont, who will? ","Were not raising children with the love that we need to. ","Love shall be our token; love be yours and love be mine. ","Love conquers all things except poverty and toothache. ","Sex without love is merely healthy exercise.

","Humanity I love you because when youre hard up you pawn your intelligence to buy a drink. ","In art as in love, instinct is enough. ","Let love flow so that it cleanses the world. Then man can live in peace, instead of the state of turmoil he has created through his past ways of life, with all those material interests and earthly ambitions. ","Love may be or it may not, but where it is, it ought to reveal itself in its immensity. ","We do not judge the people we love. ","What I know is, is that if you do work that you love, and the work fulfills you, the rest will come. ","I say to people who care for people who are dying, if you really love that person and want to help them, be with them when their end comes close. Sit with them - you dont even have to talk. You dont have to do anything but really be there with them. ","The opposite of love is not hate, its indifference. ","I love being black in America, and especially being black in Hollywood. ","The Eskimos had fifty-two names for snow because it was important to them: there ought to be as many for love. ","Love is the most important thing in the world. Hate, we should remove from the dictionary. ","Passion is momentary; love is enduring. ","Love seeks one thing only: the good of the one loved. It leaves all the other secondary effects to take care of themselves. Love, therefore, is its own reward. ","Truth is so obscure in these times, and falsehood so established, that, unless we love the truth, we cannot know it. ","The desire for possession is insatiable, to such a point that it can survive even love itself. To love, therefore, is to sterilize the person one loves. ","We are driven by five genetic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun. ","Love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness, of hatred, of jealousy, and, most easily of all, the gate of fear. ","The Bible tells us to love our neighbors, and also to love our enemies; probably because generally they are the same people. ","We cant form our children on our own concepts; we must take them and love them as God gives them to us. ","If a person loves only one other person and is indifferent to all others, his love is not love but a symbiotic attachment, or an enlarged egotism. ","Romantic love is mental illness. But its a pleasurable one. Its a drug. It distorts reality, and thats the point of it. It would be impossible to fall in love with someone that you really saw. ","Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing. ","Smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women. ","When you start falling for somebody and you cant stop thinking about when youre going to see them again, I love that. Women are beautiful. They deserve to be cherished and respected. ","Anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their objects than love. ","Love: A temporary insanity curable by marriage. ","What I cannot love, I overlook. Is that real friendship? ","Wine comes in at the mouth And love comes in at the eye; Thats all we shall know for truth Before we grow old and die. ","The body is a house of many windows: there we all sit, showing ourselves and crying on the passers-by to come and love us. ","Trust in what you love, continue to do it, and it will take you where you need to go. ","If you find someone you love in your life, then hang on to that love. ","Gods truth judges created things out of love, and Satans truth judges them out of envy and hatred. ","Girls we love for what they are; young men for what they promise to be. ","There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man. ","True love is eternal, infinite, and always like itself. It is equal and pure, without violent demonstrations: it is seen with white hairs and is always young in the heart. ","Above our life we love a steadfast friend. ","Food, love, career, and mothers, the four major guilt groups. ","Life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind. ","Even if a unity of faith is not possible, a unity of love is. ","Love seeketh not itself to please, nor for itself hath any care, but for another gives its ease, and builds a Heaven in Hells despair. ","I will not be just a tourist in the world of images, just watching images passing by which I cannot live in, make love to, possess as permanent sources of joy and ecstasy. ","The things that we love tell us what we are. ","There are fathers who do not love their children; there is no grandfather who does not adore his grandson. ","What I needed most was to love and to be loved, eager to be caught. Happily I wrapped those painful bonds around me; and sure enough, I would be lashed with the red-hot pokers or jealousy, by suspicions and fear, by burst of anger and quarrels. ","I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything. ","There is a fountain of youth: it is your mind, your talents, the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of people you love. When you learn to tap this source, you will truly have defeated age. ","I never knew how to worship until I knew how to love. ","Smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women.

","One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well. ","If one is desperate for love, I suggest looking at ones friends and family and see if love is all around. If not, get a new set of friends, a new family. ","I work really hard at trying to see the big picture and not getting stuck in ego. I believe were all put on this planet for a purpose, and we all have a different purpose... When you connect with that love and that compassion, thats when everything unfolds.

","Behold, my friends, the spring is come; the earth has gladly received the embraces of the sun, and we shall soon see the results of their love! ","Where there is great love, there are always wishes. ","You dont have to be singing about love all the time in order to give love to the people. You dont have to keep flashing those words all the time. ","In the silence of night I have often wished for just a few words of love from one man, rather than the applause of thousands of people. ","True love cannot be found where it does not exist, nor can it be denied where it does. ","Salvation and Christs love is a gift. You dont earn it. Youve got to receive that gift. ","Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. ","This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life. Finally, to take a step without feet. ","Even though we are deceived, still believe. Though we are betrayed, still forgive. Love completely even those who hate you. ","When people are lame, they love to blame. ","Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain it. ","The great gift of Easter is hope - Christian hope which makes us have that confidence in God, in his ultimate triumph, and in his goodness and love, which nothing can shake. ","I do not want a husband who honours me as a queen, if he does not love me as a woman. ","Love and work... work and love, thats all there is. ","Look your best - who said love is blind? ","My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or blessed, believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. ","Its not an act. I love it. Its totally original. People go, Whats going on with this guy? Why does he sound so weird? What is going on in his brain. I dont know. Just one day I suddenly woke up with a new brain. ","We cannot fashion our children after our desires, we must have them and love them as God has given them to us. ","I love producing. I am loving doing that. I think that is my most natural space in the business. I just love producing or editing and thats where I thrive. ","Normal love isnt interesting. I assure you that its incredibly boring. ","Love implies anger. The man who is angered by nothing cares about nothing. ","It is not love that is blind, but jealousy. ","Because parents have power over children. They feel they have to do what their parents say. But the love of money is the root of all evil. And this is a sweet child. And to see him turn like this, this isnt him. This is not him. ","I met in the street a very poor young man who was in love. His hat was old, his coat worn, his cloak was out at the elbows, the water passed through his shoes, - and the stars through his soul. ","Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh. ","When youre taught to love everyone, to love your enemies, then what value does that place on love? ","The hardest people to reach with the love of God are not the bad people. They know they are bad. They have no defense. The hardest ones to win for God are the self-righteous people. ","Where love is concerned, too much is not even enough. ","Marriage is not a noun; its a verb. It isnt something you get. Its something you do. Its the way you love your partner every day. ","If were destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff, theres got to be a very powerful energy to fight that. I think we need more love in the world. We need more kindness, more compassion, more joy, more laughter. I definitely wan","Grief is the price we pay for love. ","Love is union with somebody, or something, outside oneself, under the condition of retaining the separateness and integrity of ones own self. ","Give a little love to a child, and you get a great deal back. ","Its funny the way most people love the dead. Once you are dead, you are made for life. ","So long as we love, we serve; so long as we are loved by others, I should say that we are almost indispensable; and no man is useless while he has a friend. ","Love is like the measles. The older you get it, the worse the attack. ","I think every girl needs to love herself, regardless of anything. Like if youre having a bad day, if you dont like your hair, if you dont have the best family situation, whatever, you have to love yourself and you cant do anything until you love yourself first. ","Dont ever criticize yourself. Dont go around all day long thinking, Im unattractive, Im slow, Im not as smart as my brother. God wasnt having a bad day when he made you...

","Study nature, love nature, stay close to nature. It will never fail you. ","Chemistry can be a good and bad thing. Chemistry is good when you make love with it. Chemistry is bad when you make crack with it. ","First and last, what is demanded of genius is love of truth. ","My songs have always been frustrating themes, relationships that Ive had. And now that Im in love, I expect it to be really happy, or at least there wont be half as much anger as there was. ","To fall in love is easy, even to remain in it is not difficult; our human loneliness is cause enough. But it is a hard quest worth making to find a comrade through whose steady presence one becomes steadily the person one desires to be. ","Young love is a flame; very pretty, often very hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. The love of the older and disciplined heart is as coals, deep-burning, unquenchable. ","Love can do much, but duty more. ","If you love something let it go free. If it doesnt come back, you never had it. If it comes back, love it forever. ","Love has features which pierce all hearts, he wears a bandage which conceals the faults of those beloved. He has wings, he comes quickly and flies away the same. ","There is a courtesy of the heart; it is allied to love. From its springs the purest courtesy in the outward behavior. ","Love is moral even without legal marriage, but marriage is immoral without love. ","I feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people. ","However rare true love may be, it is less so than true friendship. ","There is nothing wrong with America that faith, love of freedom, intelligence, and energy of her citizens cannot cure. ","Falling in love is the best way to kill your heart because then its not yours anymore. Its laid in a coffin, waiting to be cremated. ","If you dont love me, it does not matter, anyway I can love for both of us. ","You should hurry up and acquire the cigar habit. Its one of the major happinesses. And so much more lasting than love, so much less costly in emotional wear and tear. ","Prayer does not use up artificial energy, doesnt burn up any fossil fuel, doesnt pollute. Neither does song, neither does love, neither does the dance. ","Women have simple tastes. They get pleasure out of the conversation of children in arms and men in love. ","The first time you marry for love, the second for money, and the third for companionship. ","Unless you love someone, nothing else makes any sense. ","All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family - and Gods love - this world would be a far more gentle and better place. ","How I Love Lucy was born? We decided that instead of divorce lawyers profiting from our mistakes, wed profit from them. ","I believe were all in denial about the people we love. ","A ladys imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment. ","My trust in a higher power that wants me to survive and have love in my life, is what keeps me moving forward. ","Mothers are the people who love us for no good reason. And those of us who are mothers know its the most exquisite love of all. ","Without contraries is no progression. Attraction and repulsion, reason and energy, love and hate, are necessary to human existence. ","The impulse to cruelty is, in many people, almost as violent as the impulse to sexual love - almost as violent and much more mischievous. ","Money can buy you a fine dog, but only love can make him wag his tail. ","Im in trouble because Im normal and slightly arrogant. A lot of people dont like themselves and I happen to be totally in love with myself. ","I love romance. Im a sucker for it. I love it so much. Its pathetic. ","It is not likely that posterity will fall in love with us, but not impossible that it may respect or sympathize; so a man would rather leave behind him the portrait of his spirit than a portrait of his face. ","If there is such a thing as a good marriage, it is because it resembles friendship rather than love. ","This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love: the more they give, the more they possess. ","Its possible to love a human being if you dont know them too well. ","Love does not alter the beloved, it alters itself. ","Nobody loves a woman because she is handsome or ugly, stupid or intelligent. We love because we love. ","I love power. But it is as an artist that I love it. I love it as a musician loves his violin, to draw out its sounds and chords and harmonies. ","I have a love interest in every one of my films: a gun. ","That best portion of a mans life, his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and love. ","Only the broken-hearted know the truth about love. ","The truth is I love being alive. And I love feeling free. So if I cant have those things then I feel like a caged animal and Id rather not be in a cage. Id rather be dead. And its real simple. And I think its not that uncommon. ","I love everything thats old, - old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wine. ","Be strong, believe in freedom and in God, love yourself, understand your sexuality, have a sense of humor, masturbate, dont judge people by their religion, color or sexual habits, love life and your family. ","All brave men love; for he only is brave who has affections to fight for, whether in the daily battle of life, or in physical contests. ","There is nothing I love as much as a good fight. ","The love of learning, the sequestered nooks, And all the sweet serenity of books. ","To be in love is merely to be in a state of perceptual anesthesia - to mistake an ordinary young woman for a goddess. ","About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some wont like you at all. ","This love is silent. ","The essence of life is finding something you really love and then making the daily experience worthwhile. ","Do what you love to do and give it your very best. Whether its business or baseball, or the theater, or any field. If you dont love what youre doing and you cant give it your best, get out of it. Life is too short. Youll be an old man before you know it. ","Love is not a mere impulse, it must contain truth, which is law. ","To love someone means to see him as God intended him. ","Men shrink less from offending one who inspires love than one who inspires fear. ","The first symptom of love in a young man is timidity; in a girl boldness. ","Love is all, it gives all, and it takes all. ","Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness. ","I like America, just as everybody else does. I love America, I gotta say that. But America will be judged. ","The more one does and sees and feels, the more one is able to do, and the more genuine may be ones appreciation of fundamental things like home, and love, and understanding companionship. ","Love has reasons which reason cannot understand. ","We live in the world when we love it. ","Never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel, for love is not ours to command. ","We look forward to the time when the Power of Love will replace the Love of Power. Then will our world know the blessings of peace. ","Did I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someones face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love? These are the real questions. I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will be many fruits, here in this world and the life to","Faith is love taking the form of aspiration. ","Love is a portion of the soul itself, and it is of the same nature as the celestial breathing of the atmosphere of paradise. ","The word love has by no means the same sense for both sexes, and this is one cause of the serious misunderstandings that divide them. ","A man always remembers his first love with special tenderness, but after that he begins to bunch them. ","We are not held back by the love we didnt receive in the past, but by the love were not extending in the present. ","The extent of your consciousness is limited only by your ability to love and to embrace with your love the space around you, and all it contains. ","But when women are moved and lend help, when women, who are by nature calm and controlled, give encouragement and applause, when virtuous and knowledgeable women grace the endeavor with their sweet love, then it is invincible. ","Love is never defeated, and I could add, the history of Ireland proves it. ","You dont walk away if you love someone. You help the person. ","True love doesnt come to you it has to be inside you. ","To all the other dreamers out there, dont ever stop or let the worlds negativity disenchant you or your spirit. If you surround yourself with love and the right people, anything is possible. ","I hate losing and cricket being my first love, once I enter the ground its a different zone altogether and that hunger for winning is always there. ","The highest patriotism is not a blind acceptance of official policy, but a love of ones country deep enough to call her to a higher plain. ","The three hardest tasks in the world are neither physical feats nor intellectual achievements, but moral acts: to return love for hate, to include the excluded, and to say, I was wrong. ","Doing stand-up is like running across a frozen pond with the ice breaking behind you. I love it because its dangerous. ","I love the name of honor, more than I fear death. ","You will reciprocally promise love, loyalty and matrimonial honesty. We only want for you this day that these words constitute the principle of your entire life and that with the help of divine grace you will observe these solemn vows that today, before God, you formulate. ","Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius. ","There are more people who wish to be loved than there are who are willing to love. ","The best portion of a good mans life is his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and of love. ","Love is a chain of love as nature is a chain of life. ","Theres a big difference between falling in love with someone and falling in love with someone and getting married. Usually, after you get married, you fall in love with the person even more. ","It is one of the severest tests of friendship to tell your friend his faults. So to love a man that you cannot bear to see a stain upon him, and to speak painful truth through loving words, that is friendship. ","To love is to act. ","If so many men, so many minds, certainly so many hearts, so many kinds of love. ","Love always brings difficulties, that is true, but the good side of it is that it gives energy. ","Just as in earthly life lovers long for the moment when they are able to breathe forth their love for each other, to let their souls blend in a soft whisper, so the mystic longs for the moment when in prayer he can, as it were, creep into God. ","A test of a people is how it behaves toward the old. It is easy to love children. Even tyrants and dictators make a point of being fond of children. But the affection and care for the old, the incurable, the helpless are the true gold mines of a culture. ","All happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love. ","People everywhere love Windows. ","I love my son and am proud of my son. ","I have a great love and respect for religion, great love and respect for atheism. What I hate is agnosticism, people who do not choose. ","The motto of chivalry is also the motto of wisdom; to serve all, but love only one. ","Adultery is the application of democracy to love. ","Love is whatever you can still betray. Betrayal can only happen if you love. ","I have never been a material girl. My father always told me never to love anything that cannot love you back. ","There is hardly any activity, any enterprise, which is started out with such tremendous hopes and expectations, and yet which fails so regularly, as love. ","Honesty does not always bring a response of love, but it is absolutely essential to it. ","Your feelings so are important to write down, to capture, and to remember because today youre heartbroken, but tomorrow youll be in love again. ","Nothing is wrong with peace and love. It is all the more regrettable that so many of Christs followers seem to disagree. ","Marrying for love may be a bit risky, but it is so honest that God cant help but smile on it. ","Whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country, it is a sign that he expects to be paid for it. ","Love is a special word, and I use it only when I mean it. You say the word too much and it becomes cheap. ","Love of man for woman - love of woman for man. Thats the nature, the meaning, the best of life itself. ","Ages of experience have taught humanity that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society. ","And all people live, Not by reason of any care they have for themselves, But by the love for them that is in other people. ","Love is the delightful interval between meeting a beautiful girl and discovering that she looks like a haddock. ","The distinction between children and adults, while probably useful for some purposes, is at bottom a specious one, I feel. There are only individual egos, crazy for love. ","Love is an emotion that is based on an opinion of women that is impossible for those who have had any experience with them. ","Little children are still the symbol of the eternal marriage between love and duty. ","You may call God love, you may call God goodness. But the best name for God is compassion. ","There are four questions of value in life, Don Octavio. What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for and what is worth dying for? The answer to each is the same. Only love. ","Love alone is capable of uniting living beings in such a way as to complete and fulfill them, for it alone takes them and joins them by what is deepest in themselves. ","I have felt cats rubbing their faces against mine and touching my cheek with claws carefully sheathed. These things, to me, are expressions of love. ","Were never so vulnerable than when we trust someone - but paradoxically, if we cannot trust, neither can we find love or joy. ","To be happy with a man you must understand him a lot and love him a little. To be happy with a woman you must love her a lot and not try to understand her at all. ","Love is anterior to life, posterior to death, initial of creation, and the exponent of breath. ","Everybodys journey is individual. If you fall in love with a boy, you fall in love with a boy. The fact that many Americans consider it a disease says more about them than it does about homosexuality. ","Italy, and the spring and first love all together should suffice to make the gloomiest person happy. ","Only the really plain people know about love - the very fascinating ones try so hard to create an impression that they soon exhaust their talents. ","I dont love studying. I hate studying. I like learning. Learning is beautiful. ","What a grand thing, to be loved! What a grander thing still, to love! ","The essential elements of giving are power and love - activity and affection - and the consciousness of the race testifies that in the high and appropriate exercise of these is a blessedness greater than any other. ","The best way to know God is to love many things. ","But I always think that the best way to know God is to love many things. ","So, fall asleep love, loved by me... for I know love, I am loved by thee. "};
