    			String[] quote={"I know where Im going and I know the truth, and I dont have to be what you want me to be. Im free to be what I want. ","Be Impeccable With Your Word. Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love. ","Follow your dreams, work hard, practice and persevere. Make sure you eat a variety of foods, get plenty of exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle. ","We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. Its never your fault. But its always your fault, because if you wanted to change youre the one who has got to change. ","Always desire to learn something useful. ","If you want to succeed you should strike out on new paths, rather than travel the worn paths of accepted success. ","Learning is the beginning of wealth. Learning is the beginning of health. Learning is the beginning of spirituality. Searching and learning is where the miracle process all begins. ","What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals. ","Set your sights high, the higher the better. Expect the most wonderful things to happen, not in the future but right now. Realize that nothing is too good. Allow absolutely nothing to hamper you or hold you up in any way. ","Ive worked too hard and too long to let anything stand in the way of my goals. I will not let my teammates down and I will not let myself down. ","Things do not happen. Things are made to happen. ","Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. ","Be gentle to all and stern with yourself. ","If you want to conquer fear, dont sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy. ","If you ask me what I came into this life to do, I will tell you: I came to live out loud. ","Opportunity does not knock, it presents itself when you beat down the door. ","You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else. ","Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines. ","Well done is better than well said. ","Id rather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed. ","The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. ","True happiness involves the full use of ones power and talents. ","What you do today can improve all your tomorrows. ","If you dont like how things are, change it! Youre not a tree. ","Your talent is Gods gift to you. What you do with it is your gift back to God. ","Never complain and never explain. ","Quality is not an act, it is a habit. ","The more man meditates upon good thoughts, the better will be his world and the world at large. ","The first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself. ","Set your goals high, and dont stop till you get there. ","Its always too early to quit. ","Leap, and the net will appear. ","When you fail you learn from the mistakes you made and it motivates you to work even harder. ","You cant build a reputation on what you are going to do. ","The secret of getting ahead is getting started. ","Crave for a thing, you will get it. Renounce the craving, the object will follow you by itself. ","You can never quit. Winners never quit, and quitters never win. ","Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible. ","Who seeks shall find. ","The hardships that I encountered in the past will help me succeed in the future. ","In motivating people, youve got to engage their minds and their hearts. I motivate people, I hope, by example - and perhaps by excitement, by having productive ideas to make others feel involved. ","The most effective way to do it, is to do it. ","Begin to be now what you will be hereafter. ","Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other. ","Fear cannot be without hope nor hope without fear. ","Go big or go home. Because its true. What do you have to lose? ","You cant wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club. ","You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand. ","I can, therefore I am. ","Motivation is the art of getting people to do what you want them to do because they want to do it. ","Perseverance is failing 19 times and succeeding the 20th. ","You need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals. ","Do your work with your whole heart, and you will succeed - theres so little competition. ","Small deeds done are better than great deeds planned. ","No matter how many goals you have achieved, you must set your sights on a higher one. ","Know or listen to those who know. ","Without hard work, nothing grows but weeds. ","You cant expect to hit the jackpot if you dont put a few nickels in the machine. ","I really believe that everyone has a talent, ability, or skill that he can mine to support himself and to succeed in life. ","Only the educated are free. ","Wherever you are - be all there. ","In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can. ","The wise does at once what the fool does at last. ","To be a good loser is to learn how to win. ","Be thine own palace, or the worlds thy jail. ","The will to succeed is important, but whats more important is the will to prepare. ","Infuse your life with action. Dont wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth. ","The weeds keep multiplying in our garden, which is our mind ruled by fear. Rip them out and call them by name. ","Ive found that luck is quite predictable. If you want more luck, take more chances. Be more active. Show up more often. ","I was motivated to be different in part because I was different. ","One way to keep momentum going is to have constantly greater goals. ","The ultimate aim of the ego is not to see something, but to be something. ","Poverty was the greatest motivating factor in my life. ","I learned that we can do anything, but we cant do everything... at least not at the same time. So think of your priorities not in terms of what activities you do, but when you do them. Timing is everything. ","What is called genius is the abundance of life and health. ","To know oneself, one should assert oneself. ","Do not weep; do not wax indignant. Understand. ","The dog that trots about finds a bone. ","There is nothing deep down inside us except what we have put there ourselves. ","If youve got a talent, protect it. ","We make the world we live in and shape our own environment. ","Go for it now. The future is promised to no one. ","You never know what motivates you. ","One may miss the mark by aiming too high as too low. ","If you think you can do it, you can. ","To be wholly devoted to some intellectual exercise is to have succeeded in life. ","Big shots are only little shots who keep shooting. ","Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage. ","Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye. ","Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead. ","Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies. ","Friends can help each other. A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to feel. Or, not feel. Whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them. Thats what real love amounts to - letting a person be what he really is. ","Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable. ","Affection is responsible for nine-tenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our lives. ","I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear. ","Immature love says: I love you because I need you. Mature love says I need you because I love you. ","Where there is love there is life. ","A man reserves his true and deepest love not for the species of woman in whose company he finds himself electrified and enkindled, but for that one in whose company he may feel tenderly drowsy. ","A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous. ","A loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge. ","Were born alone, we live alone, we die alone. Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that were not alone. ","I have found the paradox, that if you love until it hurts, there can be no more hurt, only more love. ","For it was not into my ear you whispered, but into my heart. It was not my lips you kissed, but my soul. ","A flower cannot blossom without sunshine, and man cannot live without love. ","Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. ","Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up. ","If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you. ","A woman knows the face of the man she loves as a sailor knows the open sea. ","Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do... but how much love we put in that action. ","Can miles truly separate you from friends... If you want to be with someone you love, arent you already there? ","Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love. ","A man is already halfway in love with any woman who listens to him. ","Love is a force more formidable than any other. It is invisible - it cannot be seen or measured, yet it is powerful enough to transform you in a moment, and offer you more joy than any material possession could. ","A kiss makes the heart young again and wipes out the years. ","Absence diminishes mediocre passions and increases great ones, as the wind extinguishes candles and fans fires. ","Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity. ","Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another. ","Do all things with love. ","At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. ","Come live in my heart, and pay no rent. ","I was born with an enormous need for affection, and a terrible need to give it. ","Love yourself first and everything else falls into line. You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world. ","If you press me to say why I loved him, I can say no more than because he was he, and I was I. ","Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship - never. ","Love is always bestowed as a gift - freely, willingly and without expectation. We dont love to be loved; we love to love. ","A very small degree of hope is sufficient to cause the birth of love. ","Love is like war: easy to begin but very hard to stop. ","Love is life. And if you miss love, you miss life. ","A part of kindness consists in loving people more than they deserve. ","Faith makes all things possible... love makes all things easy. ","The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. ","Love can sometimes be magic. But magic can sometimes... just be an illusion. ","The best proof of love is trust. ","Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can grow, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky. ","Love isnt something you find. Love is something that finds you. ","All my life, my heart has yearned for a thing I cannot name. ","A loving heart is the truest wisdom. ","I like not only to be loved, but also to be told I am loved. ","We love life, not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving. ","What we have once enjoyed we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us. ","The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved; loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves. ","As soon go kindle fire with snow, as seek to quench the fire of love with words. ","The hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread. ","All love shifts and changes. I dont know if you can be wholeheartedly in love all the time. ","We loved with a love that was more than love. ","The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden, a dim twilight, and a fountain singing to it. You and you alone make me feel that I am alive. Other men it is said have seen angels, but I have seen thee and thou art enough. ","A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love. ","Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit. ","I can live without money, but I cannot live without love. ","Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. ","True love is like ghosts, which everyone talks about and few have seen. ","Love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place. ","First love is only a little foolishness and a lot of curiosity. ","I was about half in love with her by the time we sat down. Thats the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty... you fall half in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are. ","Someday, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love, and then, for a second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire. ","You will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love. ","The way to love anything is to realize that it may be lost. ","We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love. ","Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired. ","The moment you have in your heart this extraordinary thing called love and feel the depth, the delight, the ecstasy of it, you will discover that for you the world is transformed. ","The one thing we can never get enough of is love. And the one thing we never give enough is love. ","It is sad not to love, but it is much sadder not to be able to love. ","For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love. ","If you wish to be loved, show more of your faults than your virtues. ","Love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own. ","Love is the flower youve got to let grow. ","If you want to be loved, be lovable. ","Love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is done well. ","Before I met my husband, Id never fallen in love. Id stepped in it a few times. ","Love is the beauty of the soul. ","Its useless to hold a person to anything he says while hes in love, drunk, or running for office. ","To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance. ","Only do what your heart tells you. ","Love is a better teacher than duty. ","Love is a game that two can play and both win. ","You never lose by loving. You always lose by holding back. ","Dont brood. Get on with living and loving. You dont have forever. ","Everything is clearer when youre in love. ","How absurd and delicious it is to be in love with somebody younger than yourself. Everybody should try it. ","Love is when you meet someone who tells you something new about yourself. ","It is difficult to know at what moment love begins; it is less difficult to know that it has begun. ","Love does not dominate; it cultivates. ","A kiss is a rosy dot over the i of loving. ","Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence. ","The art of love is largely the art of persistence. ","To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead. ","Love is being stupid together. ","Looking back, I have this to regret, that too often when I loved, I did not say so. ","Love is an act of endless forgiveness, a tender look which becomes a habit. ","When love is not madness, it is not love. ","To say I love you one must first be able to say the I. ","A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. ","I love that feeling of being in love, the effect of having butterflies when you wake up in the morning. That is special. ","Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same. ","Gestures, in love, are incomparably more attractive, effective and valuable than words. ","Absence - that common cure of love. ","I believe in the compelling power of love. I do not understand it. I believe it to be the most fragrant blossom of all this thorny existence. ","There is no disguise which can hide love for long where it exists, or simulate it where it does not. ","Love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by imagination. ","Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within. ","Blessed is the influence of one true, loving human soul on another. ","Love is supreme and unconditional; like is nice but limited. ","In love the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two. ","Love is a friendship set to music. ","Love is the joy of the good, the wonder of the wise, the amazement of the Gods. ","Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs. ","Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other. ","All mankind love a lover. ","Sometimes its a form of love just to talk to somebody that you have nothing in common with and still be fascinated by their presence. ","One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving. ","There is no remedy for love but to love more. ","Life is the flower for which love is the honey. ","There is a woman at the begining of all great things. ","Be of love a little more careful than of anything. ","The degree of loving is measured by the degree of giving. ","To love another person is to see the face of God. ","The sweetest of all sounds is that of the voice of the woman we love. ","Lord, grant that I might not so much seek to be loved as to love. ","What love weve given, well have forever. What love we fail to give, will be lost for all eternity. ","Love knows not distance; it hath no continent; its eyes are for the stars. ","Love is of all passions the strongest, for it attacks simultaneously the head, the heart and the senses. ","If you could only love enough, you could be the most powerful person in the world. ","The most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire. ","There is only one kind of love, but there are a thousand imitations. ","Love shall be our token; love be yours and love be mine. ","Follow love and it will flee, flee love and it will follow thee. ","Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence. ","Love means to commit yourself without guarantee. ","Love is the hardest habit to break, and the most difficult to satisfy. ","Falling in love consists merely in uncorking the imagination and bottling the common sense. ","Love is my religion - I could die for it. ","There is no surprise more magical than the surprise of being loved: It is Gods finger on mans shoulder. ","He is not a lover who does not love forever. ","Each moment of a happy lovers hour is worth an age of dull and common life. ","Love is all we have, the only way that each can help the other. ","Who, being loved, is poor? ","Your words are my food, your breath my wine. You are everything to me. ","Love is what youve been through with somebody. ","Love is the only reality and it is not a mere sentiment. It is the ultimate truth that lies at the heart of creation. ","Fortune and love favor the brave. ","Love takes up where knowledge leaves off. ","There are never enough I Love Yous. ","Love is the greatest refreshment in life. ","Tell me who admires and loves you, and I will tell you who you are. ","There is always something left to love. And if you aint learned that, you aint learned nothing. ","Come live with me and be my love, And we will all the pleasures prove, That valleys, groves, hills, and fields, Woods, or steepy mountain yields. ","Love is the great miracle cure. Loving ourselves works miracles in our lives. ","The only abnormality is the incapacity to love. ","Love is suffering. One side always loves more. ","Love is an emotion experienced by the many and enjoyed by the few. ","Down on your knees, and thank heaven, fasting, for a good mans love. ","Love is only a dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the species. ","Love is a gross exaggeration of the difference between one person and everybody else. ","When we are in love we seem to ourselves quite different from what we were before. ","Choose your love, Love your choice. ","People who throw kisses are hopelessly lazy. ","Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. ","Love is but the discovery of ourselves in others, and the delight in the recognition. ","Sometimes its hard to be a woman giving all your love to just one man. ","If you wished to be loved, love. ","In every living thing there is the desire for love. ","Love is always being given where it is not required. ","Friendship is Love without his wings! ","Love looks through a telescope; envy, through a microscope. ","Love is that splendid triggering of human vitality the supreme activity which nature affords anyone for going out of himself toward someone else. ","Love possesses not nor will it be possessed, for love is sufficient unto love. ","The fact is that love is of two kinds, one which commands, and one which obeys. The two are quite distinct, and the passion to which the one gives rise is not the passion of the other. ","To love abundantly is to live abundantly, and to love forever is to live forever. ","If thou must love me, let it be for naught except for loves sake only. ","Sympathy constitutes friendship; but in love there is a sort of antipathy, or opposing passion. Each strives to be the other, and both together make up one whole. ","When you love a man, he becomes more than a body. His physical limbs expand, and his outline recedes, vanishes. He is rich and sweet and right. He is part of the world, the atmosphere, the blue sky and the blue water. ","The way to know life is to love many things. ","Take away love and our earth is a tomb. ","We may give without loving, but we cannot love without giving. ","Love is the child of illusion and the parent of disillusion. ","The quarrels of lovers are the renewal of love. ","Love is the word used to label the sexual excitement of the young, the habituation of the middle-aged, and the mutual dependence of the old. ","The giving of love is an education in itself. ","Love is the delusion that one woman differs from another. ","Love conquers all. ","I dont know that love changes. People change. Circumstances change. ","Do you have to have a reason for loving? ","When youre in love you never really know whether your elation comes from the qualities of the one you love, or if it attributes them to her; whether the light which surrounds her like a halo comes from you, from her, or from the meeting of your sparks. ","What the world really needs is more love and less paper work. ","Love is the power to see similarity in the dissimilar. ","To love for the sake of being loved is human, but to love for the sake of loving is angelic. ","Let no one who loves be unhappy, even love unreturned has its rainbow. ","You dont have to go looking for love when its where you come from. ","Love is the only gold. ","Love is a springtime plant that perfumes everything with its hope, even the ruins to which it clings. ","Love you will find only where you may show yourself weak without provoking strength. ","Loves greatest gift is its ability to make everything it touches sacred. ","The truth is that there is only one terminal dignity - love. And the story of a love is not important - what is important is that one is capable of love. It is perhaps the only glimpse we are permitted of eternity. ","Pains of love be sweeter far than all other pleasures are. ","Only love interests me, and I am only in contact with things that revolve around love. ","You dont want to love - your eternal and abnormal craving is to be loved. You arent positive, youre negative. You absorb, absorb, as if you must fill yourself up with love, because youve got a shortage somewhere. ","To good and true love fear is forever affixed. ","The first magic of love is our ignorance that it can ever end. ","To witness two lovers is a spectacle for the gods. ","More than kisses, letters mingle souls. ","Who so loves believes the impossible. ","Only divine love bestows the keys of knowledge. ","There is room in the smallest cottage for a happy loving pair. ","Love ceases to be a pleasure when it ceases to be a secret. ","We can only learn to love by loving. ","The richest love is that which submits to the arbitration of time. ","What is love? It is the morning and the evening star. ","True love is quiescent, except in the nascent moments of true humility. ","Ultimately love is everything. ","It is very easy to love alone. ","Love is metaphysical gravity. ","We are most alive when were in love. ","In love there are two things - bodies and words. ","We love but once, for once only are we perfectly equipped for loving. ","Love is an energy which exists of itself. It is its own value. ","Who would give a law to lovers? Love is unto itself a higher law. ","Love is loves reward. ","We perceive when love begins and when it declines by our embarrassment when alone together. ","With our love, we could save the world. ","But loves a malady without a cure. ","Love is much nicer to be in than an automobile accident, a tight girdle, a higher tax bracket or a holding pattern over Philadelphia. ","Who ever loved that loved not at first sight? ","Is it not by love alone that we succeed in penetrating to the very essence of being? ","Love is blind. ","I long for the raised voice, the howl of rage or love. ","No one has ever loved anyone the way everyone wants to be loved. ","Love is a hole in the heart. ","There is more pleasure in loving than in being beloved. ","Love is the magician that pulls man out of his own hat. ","Oh, love will make a dog howl in rhyme. ","All love is vanquished by a succeeding love. ","To enlarge or illustrate this power and effect of love is to set a candle in the sun. ","Who loves, raves. ","The cure for all the ills and wrongs, the cares, the sorrows, and the crimes of humanity, all lie in the one word love. It is the divine vitality that everywhere produces and restores life. ","One must not trifle with love. ","When we lose one we love, our bitterest tears are called forth by the memory of hours when we loved not enough. ","In our life there is a single color, as on an artists palette, which provides the meaning of life and art. It is the color of love. ","Love is when he gives you a piece of your soul, that you never knew was missing. ","All love is lost but upon God alone. ","Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. ","Life is a song - sing it. Life is a game - play it. Life is a challenge - meet it. Life is a dream - realize it. Life is a sacrifice - offer it. Life is love - enjoy it. ","We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies. ","When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. ","Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none. ","Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life. ","You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. ","A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person. ","To love beauty is to see light. ","There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love. ","My great hope is to laugh as much as I cry; to get my work done and try to love somebody and have the courage to accept the love in return. ","Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. ","It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages. ","All major religious traditions carry basically the same message, that is love, compassion and forgiveness the important thing is they should be part of our daily lives. ","All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesnt hurt. ","Dont aim for success if you want it; just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally. ","The love of family and the admiration of friends is much more important than wealth and privilege. ","I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death. ","Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude. ","Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them humanity cannot survive. ","Never forget the three powerful resources you always have available to you: love, prayer, and forgiveness. ","It is easy to hate and it is difficult to love. This is how the whole scheme of things works. All good things are difficult to achieve; and bad things are very easy to get. ","I love people who make me laugh.

Its so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life. ","Before marriage, a girl has to make love to a man to hold him.

My life has the tendency to fall apart when Im awake, you know? ","Christmas, my child, is love in action. Every time we love, every time we give, its Christmas.

Love one another but make not a bond of love: let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. ","Forgiveness is the final form of love. ","Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love. ","God proved His love on the Cross. When Christ hung, and bled, and died, it was God saying to the world, I love you.

And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second. ","There are four questions of value in life... What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for? The answer to each is the same. Only love. ","Rare as is true love, true friendship is rarer.

Money is not enough, money can be got, but they need your hearts to love them. So, spread your love everywhere you go. ","I know of only one duty, and that is to love. ","Weve got this gift of love, but love is like a precious plant. You cant just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think its going to get on by itself. Youve got to keep watering it. Youve got to really look after it and nurture it. ","We are not the same persons this year as last; nor are those we love. It is a happy chance if we, changing, continue to love a changed person. ","Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

","A friendship that like love is warm; A love like friendship, steady. ","The first duty of love is to listen. ","We never know the love of a parent till we become parents ourselves. ","Love will find a way through paths where wolves fear to prey. ","Show me your hands. Do they have scars from giving? Show me your feet. Are they wounded in service? Show me your heart. Have you left a place for divine love? ","Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into friend. ","Even the rich are hungry for love, for being cared for, for being wanted, for having someone to call their own. ","Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy. ","What does love look like? It has the hands to help others. It has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy. It has eyes to see misery and want. It has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men. That is what love looks like. ","Love is a fruit in season at all times, and within reach of every hand. ","Presents dont really mean much to me. I dont want to sound mawkish, but - it was the realization that I have a great many people in my life who really love me, and who I really love.

","When you start falling for somebody and you cant stop thinking about when youre going to see them again, I love that. Women are beautiful. They deserve to be cherished and respected. ","Its tangible, its solid, its beautiful. Its artistic, from my standpoint, and I just love real estate. ","Music is love, love is music, music is life, and I love my life. Thank you and good night. ","To fall in love is easy, even to remain in it is not difficult; our human loneliness is cause enough. But it is a hard quest worth making to find a comrade through whose steady presence one becomes steadily the person one desires to be. ","Love sought is good, but given unsought, is better. ","It is not love that is blind, but jealousy. ","Love seeks one thing only: the good of the one loved. It leaves all the other secondary effects to take care of themselves. Love, therefore, is its own reward. ","Love: A temporary insanity curable by marriage. ","A woman in love cant be reasonable - or she probably wouldnt be in love. ","My mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family, and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity, her compassion, her intelligence reflected in my daughters. ","Even when Im old and grey, I wont be able to play it, but Ill still love the game. ","Who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make love known? ","Love is moral even without legal marriage, but marriage is immoral without love. ","I love bringing roses to a woman when she least expects it. ","Do what you love. Know your own bone; gnaw at it, bury it, unearth it, and gnaw it still. ","So, fall asleep love, loved by me... for I know love, I am loved by thee. ","If a man walks in the woods for love of them half of each day, he is in danger of being regarded as a loafer. But if he spends his days as a speculator, shearing off those woods and making the earth bald before her time, he is deemed an industrious and enterprising citizen. ","Love and doubt have never been on speaking terms. ","Smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women. ","Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh. ","I met in the street a very poor young man who was in love. His hat was old, his coat worn, his cloak was out at the elbows, the water passed through his shoes, - and the stars through his soul. ","All married couples should learn the art of battle as they should learn the art of making love. Good battle is objective and honest - never vicious or cruel. Good battle is healthy and constructive, and brings to a marriage the principles of equal partnership. ","Love is trembling happiness. ","Adapt yourself to the things among which your lot has been cast and love sincerely the fellow creatures with whom destiny has ordained that you shall live. ","Chemistry can be a good and bad thing. Chemistry is good when you make love with it. Chemistry is bad when you make crack with it. ","Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation. ","The three hardest tasks in the world are neither physical feats nor intellectual achievements, but moral acts: to return love for hate, to include the excluded, and to say, I was wrong. ","We do not judge the people we love. ","I love America more than any other country in this world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually. ","I think my passion is misinterpreted as anger sometimes. And I dont think people are ready for the message that Im delivering, and delivering with a sense of violent love. ","Nothing can bring a real sense of security into the home except true love. ","If thou desire the love of God and man, be humble, for the proud heart, as it loves none but itself, is beloved of none but itself. Humility enforces where neither virtue, nor strength, nor reason can prevail. ","Life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind. ","The hardest people to reach with the love of God are not the bad people. They know they are bad. They have no defense. The hardest ones to win for God are the self-righteous people. ","The highest patriotism is not a blind acceptance of official policy, but a love of ones country deep enough to call her to a higher plain. ","Our dilemma is that we hate change and love it at the same time; what we really want is for things to remain the same but get better. ","All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family - and Gods love - this world would be a far more gentle and better place. ","A wedding anniversary is the celebration of love, trust, partnership, tolerance and tenacity. The order varies for any given year. ","One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well. ","You know, all that really matters is that the people you love are happy and healthy. Everything else is just sprinkles on the sundae. ","The struggle of my life created empathy - I could relate to pain, being abandoned, having people not love me. ","Let love flow so that it cleanses the world. Then man can live in peace, instead of the state of turmoil he has created through his past ways of life, with all those material interests and earthly ambitions. ","Love feels no burden, thinks nothing of trouble, attempts what is above its strength, pleads no excuse of impossibility; for it thinks all things lawful for itself, and all things possible. ","Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age. ","There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness. ","You gotta love livin, baby, cause dyin is a pain in the ass. ","Romantic love is mental illness. But its a pleasurable one. Its a drug. It distorts reality, and thats the point of it. It would be impossible to fall in love with someone that you really saw. ","All brave men love; for he only is brave who has affections to fight for, whether in the daily battle of life, or in physical contests. ","When you fish for love, bait with your heart, not your brain. ","My trust in a higher power that wants me to survive and have love in my life, is what keeps me moving forward. ","All happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love. ","Fatherhood is pretending the present you love most is soap-on-a-rope. ","There is a fountain of youth: it is your mind, your talents, the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of people you love. When you learn to tap this source, you will truly have defeated age. ","Im an introvert... I love being by myself, love being outdoors, love taking a long walk with my dogs and looking at the trees, flowers, the sky. ","Ages of experience have taught humanity that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society. ","The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge. ","Never go on trips with anyone you do not love. ","Justice that love gives is a surrender, justice that law gives is a punishment. ","Treasure the love you receive above all. It will survive long after your good health has vanished. ","A woman has two smiles that an angel might envy, the smile that accepts a lover before words are uttered, and the smile that lights on the first born babe, and assures it of a mothers love. ","In our minds, love and lust are really separated. Its hard to find someone that can be kind and you can trust enough to leave your kids with, and isnt afraid to throw her man up against the wall and lick him from head to toe. ","A man without ambition is dead. A man with ambition but no love is dead. A man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive. ","Speak low, if you speak love. ","We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect. ","He that is jealous is not in love. ","The most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love and to be greater than our suffering. ","Above our life we love a steadfast friend. ","I love my family and I miss them very much but Im a new person now. I know a lot of people will not agree with what Ive done, but it was right for me. ","A good teacher can inspire hope, ignite the imagination, and instill a love of learning. ","Dont threaten me with love, baby. Lets just go walking in the rain. ","Today I love myself as I love my god: who could charge me with a sin today? I know only sins against my god; but who knows my god? ","Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here. ","If I love you, what business is it of yours? ","Whoever loves becomes humble. Those who love have, so to speak, pawned a part of their narcissism. ","I believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear. ","Love is always open arms. If you close your arms about love you will find that you are left holding only yourself. ","If were destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff, theres got to be a very powerful energy to fight that. I think we need more love in the world. We need more kindness, more compassion, more joy, more laughter. I definitely want to contribute to that. ","True love is eternal, infinite, and always like itself. It is equal and pure, without violent demonstrations: it is seen with white hairs and is always young in the heart. ","You know its love when all you want is that person to be happy, even if youre not part of their happiness. ","This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life. Finally, to take a step without feet. ","To be happy with a man you must understand him a lot and love him a little. To be happy with a woman you must love her a lot and not try to understand her at all. ","The time I burned my guitar it was like a sacrifice. You sacrifice the things you love. I love my guitar. ","Love him and let him love you. Do you think anything else under heaven really matters? ","True love cannot be found where it does not exist, nor can it be denied where it does. ","Love does not claim possession, but gives freedom. ","Dont forget to love yourself. ","Im kind of a good girl - and Im not. Im a good girl because I really believe in love, integrity, and respect. Im a bad girl because I like to tease. I know that I have sex appeal in my deck of cards. But I like to get people thinking. Thats what the stories in my music do. ","I think I have a strange relationship with time. Im not really aware of that time passing. I dont feel that Im wasteful with time. But Im not aware of it passing. ","I think anybody who has had a long relationship and has had a really hard time letting go, wants to feel like its not all for naught, and its meaningful, because it makes you who you are. ","A lot of people over time have had this kind of pattern in their relationship with Bill Clinton. You first meet him and youre overwhelmed by his talent. Hes so energetic and articulate and full of ideas and he calls himself a congenital optimist and that optimism is contagious. ","Im so happy to be in a committed relationship. ","Minimalism seems closest to the sophisticated storytelling of movies. Movies have really educated contemporary audiences to be the most intelligent, sophisticated audiences in history. We dont any longer need to have the relationship between one scene and the next explained. We will figure it out ourselves. ","Films have never shown the kind of relationship that can exist between two women. ","Im so lucky that I have a great relationship. ","The attack on ObamaCare was that Congress does not have the power under the Commerce Clause to force a private citizen into a private contractual relationship. If such a thing is permitted to stand, the anti-ObamaCare forces argue, there will be no limit to Congresss power in the future. ","I have a need to make these sorts of connections literal sometimes, and a vehicle often helps to do that. I have a relationship to car culture. It isnt really about loving cars. Its sort of about needing them. ","I definitely think anything Id be in now is a permanent relationship. ","There was at time in my life where all I wanted was a relationship, and I thought that was the most important thing. ","My relationship with my mom is really the single most profound relationship that Ive ever had in my life. ","I like to write with people I have a relationship with; otherwise its kind of scary, and you hold back because you dont want to pour your guts out to someone you never met. ","The main thing experience has taught me is that one has to sort of hone their relationship to time, you know. ","When you look at Japanese traditional architecture, you have to look at Japanese culture and its relationship with nature. You can actually live in a harmonious, close contact with nature - this very unique to Japan. ","The test of ones behavior pattern is their relationship to society, relationship to work and relationship to sex. ","I love coming home to somebody, I love being in a relationship. ","Doing Saturday Night Live definitely affects my relationship with my girlfriend and with my family, because you feel so much pressure to do well that night. But I think everyones grown to accept that and so they give me my space at the show. ","Having been an educator for so many years I know that all a good teacher can do is set a context, raise questions or enter into a kind of a dialogic relationship with their students. ","So I wanted to sing inspirational music, and thats exactly how I approached it - only the words have been changed to declare my relationship with God. ","When youre in a relationship you want it to work. My parents did, I did. But we are not taught how to make it work. ","I cant cultivate a relationship with my child if its between takes.

","The relationship of the toastmaster to speaker should be the same as that of the fan to the fan dancer. It should call attention to the subject without making any particular effort to cover it.

Through this intimate relationship we find peace and guidance. ","Anyone working for a big company might be skeptical that a large business, or even a strictly online business, can form the same kind of friendly, loyal relationship with customers as a local retailer. Im saying its already been done because I lived it. ","Im so wrapped up in my work that its often impossible to consider other things in my life. My marriage ended in divorce because of this, my relationship with Holly has suffered by this. ","Doctrinal rightness and rightness of ecclesiastical position are important, but only as a starting point to go on into a living relationship - and not as ends in themselves.

But then, only a few feet away in the cookbook section, just about every cookbook includes recipes for cooking animals. Is there a more illuminating illustration of our paradoxical relationship with the nonhuman world? ","Jews have a special relationship to books, and the Haggadah has been translated more widely, and reprinted more often, than any other Jewish book. It is not a work of history or philosophy, not a prayer book, users manual, timeline, poem or palimpsest - and yet it is all these things. ","Ive only recently realized that I have a radically different relationship with my parents than a lot of people. ","I think every relationship has a point where you stop and reevaluate.

We have a very close, personal, loyal relationship. Im not, as they say, a potted plant in these meetings. ","I think you grow wherever God plants you.

We get paid to feign attraction and love. Other people are paying to watch us kissing someone, touching someone, doing things people in a normal monogamous relationship would never do with anyone whos not their partner. Its really kind of gross. ","I think that the fact that a relationship becomes public is a bit of a bummer. Because it can distract from the real reason why youre together, which is that you just like each other. ","Selfishness, narcissism, being uncomfortable in your own skin, not feeling connected to the world around you, feeling dislocated from family and youth, having a strange relationship with your childhood - all those things feel really true to me.

","Even as a child I had a strong relationship with yearning and desire. And loss. Those things spoke to me. ","The film depends on the audiences belief in this relationship. ","What we have now is doctors who are actually better technically at what theyre doing in their specialty than 30 or 40 years ago, but we lost the relationship, when the doctor would look people in the eye and say, I care about you. We can do this together.

I cant bring my mom back, but I can have children.

It wouldnt be at all difficult for me to kiss a woman - Ill kiss a frog if you like. ","I love the comic opportunities that come up in the context of a father-son relationship. ","With the CGI, suddenly theres a thousand enemies instead of six - the army goes off into the horizon. You dont need that. The audience loses its relationship with the threat on the screen.

I came up through folk music, and theres no pomp and circumstance to the performance. Theres no, like, Ill be the rock star, you be the adulating fan.

I mean, the level of hatred that they had, and the level of physical abuse - my mother would beat up my father, basically - and I think I was drawn to images on television that were bright and reflective. ","I had the classic 40 meltdown. I did. Its embarrassing. It was pretty funny. But then I recovered. To me, it was like a second adolescence. Hormonally, my body was changing, my mind was changing, and so my relationship to myself and the world around me came to this assault of finiteness. ","I dont think the relationship between novels and realities are one to one. Of course novels play different roles. Its essentially just a long narrative form.

So in one way its how you behave. ","Divorce is so common and accepted in America that beating myself up over it may sound ridiculous. But I was raised to believe that divorce wasnt an option; to me, divorce equaled failure. I wasnt able to change that equation until I found myself in the right relationship.

","If someone talks about union, fidelity, a monogamous relationship, love, blessing; I would say it sounds like marriage to me. And blessing, you see, I think is undermining our sacrament of marriage. ","Right now, we have the most complex relationship with technology that weve ever had. Your regular person has more technology in their life now than the whole world had 100 years ago. ","We humans have a love-hate relationship with our technology. We love each new advance and we hate how fast our world is changing... The robots really embody that love-hate relationship we have with technology. ","I had a very, very difficult relationship with my mother, who was supremely self-centred. She was hilariously self-centred.

","When youre in a relationship with somebody who is also a public personality, then it doubles the attention from the media. ","I tour alone. Theres no sound check, no back up. I stay with the hosts; I am in a family home and its really nourishing. I just have to remember after the show not to run out into the living room in my pyjamas. Every day, its a new relationship being built. Its odd and wonderful. ","If you look back on the breakups that youve had, whether its a long relationship or a one-night stand, its always awkward.

","The relationship between the government of the United States and social and indigenous movements has always been difficult. Not just in Bolivia but worldwide. We need to have bilateral relations characterized by mutual respect. ","I record all of my music with authentic instruments in a studio before we start editing, doing many, many versions. The music shapes the film as we edit so it has an organic relationship to the content.

","I have an amazing relationship with my wife, but sometimes there are arguments. It happens. ","Im not a terrible person, I know that, but sometimes in a relationship, I can be crappy.

","Having a studio tell you when to jump and how high eight months of the year for six years is not a relationship I want to get into again. ","Nothing has changed in our relationship with East West. We have no relationship with East West. Weve been withholding our labour for almost seven years now. ","It was just that we had this phenomenal honeymoon relationship that just kept on going. ","I have a love/hate relationship with just about all technology in my life. My first typewriter in particular. I had a helluva time putting new ribbon on it. ","It seems I have a hard time being attracted to someone unless I respect what they do on some level. Otherwise, I would feel disdain for them. Which is not always pleasant in a relationship. Sometimes its fun though. ","Through all the relationship stuff Ive gone through in the past few years, I know there are fundamental differences in how men and women view sex and how they view their futures. ","Ive brought my daughters all over the world-they travel with me. I drag them out of school just to keep the relationship. When Im home Im a big-time daddy. ","I believe there is a relationship between having an interest in the arts and the behaviour of society as a whole. Some politicians find it difficult that the arts is a weapon of happiness... Politics is often about deprivation rather than the opening up of ideas and nourishing creative endeavour. ","I wouldnt know what to do on a date. I dont have the time. To make a relationship work, Id have to give something up, and Im not so sure Im willing to do that. ","Its interesting now that basically a CG set is the same cost as a real set.

I didnt have a contentious relationship with my mom or dad. ","Syria and Iran have always had a pretty tight relationship, and it looks to me like they just cooked up a press release to put out to sort of restate the obvious.

","The film is about Joe discovering who his mother and father are and his relationship with them, and the identity crisis he goes through once he finds out who his parents are.

And its hard to express and its hard to execute but I think it works on every level - the choice of the material the choice of the actor, my relationship with the actor, and so on. ","Nobody ever seems to want my advice about serious stuff. People will be like: Who made that sweater? Or How did you get your hair so straight? They dont to come to me for the relationship advice or deep stuff. In fact, my little sister actually hides from me. ","This is a very important relationship we have with Russia, the relationship over the nuclear arsenal that they have obviously is important. Theyre a very powerful country. ","While I very much wanted to be in a relationship, I didnt want to be in the wrong one. ","I do want to try to put things in perspective today relative to the U.S.-Canada relationship.

","If you are strong enough as a couple, reality shows can be a good thing for the relationship. ","People dont really have a relationship with great writing or great production or great art direction or great direction. They just sort of admire it. ","When writing comedy, you have to have the confidence to believe that there is only one type of relationship in the world, and we are all having it, that all men behave in the same way and so do all women.

A thank you or a quick kiss can go a long way toward affirming your relationship and commitment to each other. Thats not hard to do even when youre juggling insane careers and three kids.

Instead, I think of more like, Ill probably be with this person for the next six weeks. Then Ill re-evaluate. ","There are a few writers that one has a relationship with that means, basically, you do whatever they say. One is Caryl Churchill, and the other is David Hare. ","I love changing.

","If youre truly in a band and you guys have been together for a long time, theres a family bond that you have.

","Each success only buys an admission ticket to a more difficult problem. ","The ability to convert ideas to things is the secret of outward success. ","Men of age object too much, consult too long, adventure too little, repent too soon, and seldom drive business home to the full period, but content themselves with a mediocrity of success.

We cant afford to throw any young people away. ","Success is always temporary. When all is said and one, the only thing youll have left is your character. ","My store, Wine Library, outsells big national chains. How do you think we do it? It started with hustle. I always say that our success wasnt due to my hundreds of online videos about wine that went viral, but to the hours I spent talking to people online afterward, making connections and building relationships.

","We moved into the back, made it into a little 50s sitting room and started to sell the records. We had an immediate success. For one thing, these Teddy Boys were thrilled to buy the records. ","Success is always something completely different to people. I feel like Ive succeeded, if Im doing something that makes me happy and Im not lying to anybody. Im not doing that now, so I feel really good about myself. ","This weird thing happens when youre in a movie that has some level of success. People start offering you all kinds of things, and they just expect you to do them because theyll be good for your career. Its not about the projects integrity or anything like that. ","Success consists in being successful, not in having potential for success. Any wide piece of ground is the potential site of a palace, but theres no palace till its built. ","I have a tendency to sabotage relationships; I have a tendency to sabotage everything. Fear of success, fear of failure, fear of being afraid. Useless, good-for-nothing thoughts. ","We can come to look upon the deaths of our enemies with as much regret as we feel for those of our friends, namely, when we miss their existence as witnesses to our success. ","The power of fortune is confessed only by the miserable, for the happy impute all their success to prudence or merit. ","Think of success as a game of chance in which you have control over the odds. As you begin to master concepts in personal achievement, you are increasing your odds of achieving success. ","Success is about enjoying what you have and where you are, while pursuing achievable goals. ","Youll never convince me there is a hopeless situation or there is any finality in any success or any failure. ","A great secret of success is to go through life as a man who never gets used up. ","Being a part of success is more important than being personally indispensable. ","It takes two to make a marriage a success and only one to make it a failure. ","There is no scientific answer for success. You cant define it. Youve simply got to live it and do it. ","The secret to success is to own nothing, but control everything. ","I did stand-up comedy for 18 years. Ten of those years were spent learning, four years were spent refining, and four years were spent in wild success. I was seeking comic originality, and fame fell on me as a byproduct. The course was more plodding than heroic. ","A sign now of success with a certain audience when you do a short comedy piece, anywhere, is that it gets on YouTube and gets around. Its always something youre thinking about unconsciously. ","Many individuals are doing what they can. But real success can only come if there is a change in our societies and in our economics and in our politics. ","The great dream merchant Disney was a success because make-believe was what everyone seemed to need in a spiritually empty land. ","My father was an immigrant who literally walked across Europe to get out of Russia. He fought in World War I. He was wounded in action. My father was a great success even though he never had money. He was a very determined man, a great role model. ","The road to success is always under construction. ","Hollywood... a city I was to come back to time and again, in sickness and in health, in success and in failure, with anticipation and with dread. ","The compensation of a very early success is a conviction that life is a romantic matter. In the best sense one stays young. ","Success is sweet and sweeter if long delayed and gotten through many struggles and defeats. ","As you walk in Gods divine wisdom, you will surely begin to see a greater measure of victory and good success in your life. ","Why be a man when you can be a success?

But there is, in this case, always tomorrow - after you have done your best to achieve success today. ","For a good 10 to 12 years, I was working non-stop and I wasnt really enjoying my success. ","Do business managers have a commitment to anything more than the success of their company and to making money? It would be hard to say that they do. Indeed, many business leaders deny that there is any conflict between self-interest and the interests of all. ","The film is not a success until it makes money. Its only good when theres a dollar figure attached to the box office. ","Ive learned its always better to have a small percentage of a big success, than a hundred percent of nothing. ","A man desires praise that he may be reassured, that he may be quit of his doubting of himself; he is indifferent to applause when he is confident of success. ","People are beginning to see that the first requisite to success in life is to be a good animal. ","Money does not guarantee success. ","The secret of success is sincerity. ","My college degree was in theater. But the real reason, if I have any success in that milieu, so to speak, is because I spent a lot of years directing, I spent a lot of years behind the camera. ","Nearly all monster stories depend for their success on Jack killing the Giant, Beowulf or St. George slaying the Dragon, Harry Potter triumphing over the basilisk. That is their inner grammar, and the whole shape of the story leads towards it. ","When humor can be made to alternate with melancholy, one has a success, but when the same things are funny and melancholic at the same time, its just wonderful. ","One man has enthusiasm for 30 minutes, another for 30 days, but it is the man who has it for 30 years who makes a success of his life. ","Nothing succeeds like the appearance of success.

","My own early experiences in war led me to suspect the value of discipline, even in that sphere where it is so often regarded as the first essential for success. ","I sort of understood that when I first started: that you shouldnt repeat a success. Very often youre going to, and maybe the first time you do, it works. And you love it. But then youre trapped. ","Ive stopped apologizing to myself for having this great period of success and financial acceptance. ","I worked half my life to be an overnight success, and still it took me by surprise. ","Because after my first year I had a lot of success, took everybody by storm, came back the next year thought it was easy and didnt have near the season I had the previous year. It was kind of a wake-up call. And so, life goes on. ","As my father used to tell me, the only true sign of success in life is being able to do for a living that which makes you happy. ","Put paying your dues and all that puts so much into being a success. You have an understanding of what its about, being on your own for three or four years and living day to day on $3, or living in an apartment with no electricity. ","Give me a couple of years, and Ill make that actress an overnight success. ","The reward of art is not fame or success but intoxication: that is why so many bad artists are unable to give it up. ","I always think Im the Tom Cruise of music - a lot of success and fans, but no critics, darling. ","I didnt have any success in show business until I was 30 to 31 years of age. ","Everyone takes pause at 40. Its the age you have to assess everything in your life. Its the fictitious marker thats always coming up when youre young. The world really does look at you to kind of have it together by 40, and be successful by 40. Whatever success means. ","Success makes you less intimidated by things. ","People still dont appreciate how ephemeral success is. ","Success depends in a very large measure upon individual initiative and exertion, and cannot be achieved except by a dint of hard work. ","Im starting to judge success by the time I have for myself, the time I spend with family and friends. My priorities arent amending; theyre shifting. ","We all know that Social Security is one of this countrys greatest success stories in the 20th century. ","Theres no right or wrong, success or failure. ","Well, success does not mean doing well. ","Remember, I come from such an excessively overdone, red-carpet place called Hollywood. So Im used to people blowing up their success in ways that are far above and beyond the truth. ","Success cant be forced. ","I feel lucky because I was a nerd, which I talk about in the book, but I had academic success, so through that, because thats what my parents put a great deal of value on, I had a great childhood because I sort of fulfilled the expectations of being good at school. ","Am I coasting on some early success? Yeah. It was a good lucky break for me. But I would rather earn my way back again than simply conform to what people are expecting. ","We were called The Toilets originally - we were flushed with success. ","There is much to be said for failure. It is much more interesting than success. ","The framers of the Constitution were so clear in the federalist papers and elsewhere that they felt an independent judiciary was critical to the success of the nation. ","Lesson from Patakis success is: Use the political moment. ","I hate the idea of success robbing you of your private life. ","The success of any great moral enterprise does not depend upon numbers. ","I passionately believe thats its not just what you say that counts, its also how you say it - that the success of your argument critically depends on your manner of presenting it. ","Im not sure anybodys ready to see me in a drama. And loving movies so much, Ive seen a lot of comics try to make that transition too fast, and it can be detrimental. And I dont think Ive had as much success as I need in the comedy genre to open up those opportunities. ","I always say be humble but be firm. Humility and openness are the key to success without compromising your beliefs. ","Singleness of purpose is one of the chief essentials for success in life, no matter what may be ones aim. ","A lot of football success is in the mind. You must believe you are the best and then make sure that you are. ","Which is - you know, like check it out, Im pretty young, Im only about 40 years old. I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me. And its exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book, right? ","I should just put it bluntly, because were all sort of friends here now - its exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me. Oh, so Jesus, what a thought! You know thats the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine oclock in the morning, and I dont want to go there. ","When somebody has an enormous success in this culture, people start asking two questions, which are What are you doing now? and How are you going to beat that? And I have to say, I love the assumption that your intention is to beat yourself constantly - that youre in battle against yourself. ","My career started young and I was really ambitious, and then I had success and I hung out with people who were much older. I think I might have been temporally misplaced, so I thought I was 40. It was a premature midlife crisis. ","Yeah, ideally, Id probably wish to be more anonymous. But scrutiny and success go together. And I want to be successful. ","The one thing that makes me feel super lucky about my financial success is that I have a housekeeper. ","If I wasnt even famous or had any success, I would still wake up and put tons of make-up on, and put on a cool outfit. Thats always been who Ive been my whole life, so thats never gonna change. I love fashion. I love getting dressed up. I love Halloween, too. ","Success produces confidence; confidence relaxes industry, and negligence ruins the reputation which accuracy had raised. ","Happy people are ignoramuses and glory is nothing else but success, and to achieve it one only has to be cunning. ","Think of yourself as on the threshold of unparalleled success. A whole, clear, glorious life lies before you. Achieve! Achieve! ","Success is a consequence and must not be a goal. ","The NFL has been an amazing page in this chapter of my life. I pray that all successive adventures offer me the same potential for growth, success and most importantly fun. ","You wanna know what scares people? Success. When you dont make moves and when you dont climb up the ladder, everybody loves you because youre not competition. ","Youve got to eat while you dream. Youve got to deliver on short-range commitments, while you develop a long-range strategy and vision and implement it. The success of doing both. Walking and chewing gum if you will.

","So many stars lose their way, and with success become more neurotic, not less so. ","I dont think success is harmful, as so many people say. Rather, I believe it indispensable to talent, if for nothing else than to increase the talent. ","The making of friends who are real friends, is the best token we have of a mans success in life. ","Hip-hop is more about attaining wealth. People respect success. They respect big. They dont even have to like your music. If youre big enough, people are drawn to you. ","When I meet successful people I ask 100 questions as to what they attribute their success to. It is usually the same: persistence, hard work and hiring good people. ","Its absolutely essential that we have the same safeguards that straight couples do. But I want more than a 50 percent chance of success. I dont want to emulate that. ","I have more love, success, and security than I could ever dream of. ","Evolution acts slowly. Our psychological characteristics today are those that promoted reproductive success in the ancestral environmen. ","It sounds cliche, but success is your friends, your family, what you do, and if youre happy when you wake up. ","I feel like I want to take care of everyone and I also feel this terrible guilt if I am unable to. And I have felt this way ever since all this success started. ","What I have in common with the character in Truman is this incredible need to please people. I feel like I want to take care of everyone and I also feel this terrible guilt if I am unable to. And I have felt this way ever since all this success started. ","Like so many American families, our families werent asking for much. They didnt begrudge anyone elses success or care that others had much more than they did... in fact, they admired it. ","I see nothing wrong with the human trait to desire. In fact, I consider it integral to our success mechanism. Becoming attached to what we desire is what causes the trouble. If you must have it in order to be happy, then you are denying the happiness of the here and now. ","In America, as opposed to the old country, success was based on merit. ","I went to America and got into a band, had success, had hits in Australia. ","No one has a corner on success. It is his who pays the price. ","I have always been pushed by the negative. The apparent failure of a play sends me back to my typewriter that very night, before the reviews are out. I am more compelled to get back to work than if I had a success. ","Anyone who wants to sell you overnight success or wealth is not interested in your success; they are interested in your money. ","The Occupy movement needs an organizing principle, and - just as the Tea Party did - it needs some actual measures of success. Choose one candidate whose agenda is squarely within that of the movement and make his or her electoral success a focal point. ","Success follows those adept at preserving the substance of the past by clothing it in the forms of the future. ","In a way, a certain amount of self-criticism is a good thing, because it keeps you humble. Realizing that no matter what success youve achieved, you can still make enemies makes you humble, too. ","Success is survival. ","The problem with being British... I dont know if its me being British or being raised a strict Catholic, but you never really enjoy success. ","With Believe bringing really big success for me outside of the U.K. for the first time, it meant I have been touring around the world and that led to a gap from the studio. I really feel like the gap has done me the world of good. Throughout that time I was able to collect songs that I really loved. ","The key to sitcom success is miserable people. If you see a happy couple, its just gone, like when Sam and Diane got together on Cheers. ","Success in life comes not from holding a good hand, but in playing a poor hand well. ","Theres no secret about success. Did you ever know a successful man who didnt tell you about it? ","Success isnt everything but it makes a man stand straight. ","Theres a lot of blood, sweat, and guts between dreams and success. ","I dont think success has changed us as people at all. We are the same lunatics that we were when this band first got going. We never see ourselves as being on a higher level than our fans. ","Not every difficult and dangerous thing is suitable for training, but only that which is conducive to success in achieving the object of our effort. ","While I was doing stand-up, I thought I knew for sure that success meant getting everyone to like me. So I became whoever I thought people wanted me to be. Id say yes when I wanted to say no, and I even wore a few dresses. ","Without failure there is no sweetness in success. Theres no understanding of it. ","Once you have a lot of success, you become a target in many ways. ","The quick success was a bit strange to get used to. ","Success is the necessary misfortune of life, but it is only to the very unfortunate that it comes early. ","By far the most important factor in the success or failure of any school, far more important than tests or standards or business-model methods of accountability, is simply attracting the best-educated, most exciting young people into urban schools and keeping them there. ","I dont think success arrives and youre suddenly happy. Its not like that. If people think that theyll be very disappointed. ","The first myth of management is that it exists. The second myth of management is that success equals skill. ","For globalization to work for America, it must work for working people. We should measure the success of our economy by the breadth of our middle class, and the scope of opportunity offered to the poorest child to climb into that middle class. ","Personal relationships are the fertile soil from which all advancement, all success, all achievement in real life grows. ","Liberals tend to put the onus of your success on society and conservatives on you and your family. ","Success depends almost entirely on how effectively you learn to manage the games two ultimate adversaries: the course and yourself. ","Well, I do feel that I carry the responsibility of representing my country wherever I am, and this responsibility came with the success that I had in last couple of years, not just myself but the whole group of tennis players that comes from Serbia. And athletes in general are, in this moment, the biggest ambassadors that our country has. ","We do not celebrate people who have made success out of serious hard work. ","Kids are meant to believe that their stepping stone to massive money is The X Factor. Luck is great, but most of life is hard work. We do not celebrate people who have made success out of serious hard work. ","Well, you cant be trying to achieve success of any kind in this business without accepting that theres going to be a flip side to it. ","Whatever success Ive had, I always like to top it. ","You know, I can be the happiest man in the world with minimal record success. ","I want to see success right away. And I want to never give up, never stop. ","True leadership lies in guiding others to success. In ensuring that everyone is performing at their best, doing the work they are pledged to do and doing it well. ","I havent deliberately set out to play the blonde bombshell in my movies. In fact, its probably been quite the opposite. After the success of The Mask, I wasnt offered all that many blonde bombshell parts, to be honest. I think people believed from the beginning that I could actually walk and talk at the same time. ","To be associated with success is absolutely wonderful. ","The kind of theater that I do is sort of narrative realism, which I think in the broadest sense is legitimate to say is mainstream. I mean, in a certain sense, Suzan-Loris plays have had mainstream levels of success. But Suzan-Lori is in some ways not a narrative realist. ","The only thing I can say about having this type of success is that you can get yourself in trouble because basically the world is set open for you. People will say yes to anything you ask, so its basically down to you and what you want or need. ","Your success story is a bigger story than whatever youre trying to say on stage. Success makes life easier. It doesnt make living easier. ","I was, if you like, a successful schoolboy in that I had a degree of talent in all the required things that make you a success at school. ","For example, the equivalent of a woman being treated as a sex object is a man being treated as a success object. ","If you can go out with your live show and turn people on to that, where you have that fan base thats religious and theyre going to come see you when youre in that town, once your radio success is gone and youre not a mainstream guy anymore you can still go out and play your shows. ","In the United States, I am a great success, but I am not a celebrity. ","Well, I think that theres a very thin dividing line between success and failure. And I think if you start a business without financial backing, youre likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line. ","There is no middle ground in Hollywood; youre a failure or youre a success. That mentality is wild. ","I think the success of a talk show depends on how true it is to the personality of the person hosting it. The shows I really admire, like Oprah and Ellen, are distinctively like their hosts, so I think my show will be successful only if we try to stay consistent to my own sense of myself. ","Though I had success in my research both when I was mad and when I was not, eventually I felt that my work would be better respected if I thought and acted like a normal person. ","It never made sense to me that someone would achieve any kind of success in show business, only to become a jerk. ","Permanent success cannot be achieved except by incessant intellectual labour, always inspired by the ideal. ","Your chances of success in any undertaking can always be measured by your belief in yourself. ","Success is more dangerous than failure, the ripples break over a wider coastline. ","I suppose your security is your success and your key to success is your fine palate. ","I think the measure of your success to a certain extent will be the amount of things written about you that arent true. ","Ive had a lot of success; Ive had failures, so I learn from the failure. ","Team GBs success at the Beijing Olympics can, in part, be said to have been made in Manchester. For example, all the cycling medal winners trained at Manchesters velodrome, the National Cycling Centre. ","For us political activists and candidates, the morning after any election is a mix of emotions - the personal and the immediate, the culmination of your own recent campaigning efforts; and the fortunes of your party and the success or otherwise of what you stand for and believe in. ","For movies to get greenlit solely based on the success of other movies that have a lot of women in them? Its so ridiculous to me. ","A variety of national and international studies indicate that the broad-based deployment of information technology can have a substantial impact on our nations economic productivity and growth as well as the educational and social success of our citizens. ","Success always necessitates a degree of ruthlessness. Given the choice of friendship or success, Id probably choose success. ","One of the rewards of success is freedom, the ability to do whatever you like. ","I have no time for those who say there is no way Scotland could go it alone. I know first-hand the contribution Scotland and Scots make to Britains success - so for me theres no question about whether Scotland could be an independent nation. ","Happy Days was about a family... although the show was shot in the 70s, it was about a family in the 50s. I realized that kids were watching their parents grow up and the parents were watching themselves grow up. That was the key to the success of our show. ","I want to swim in both directions at once. Desire success, court failure. ","My formula for success is rise early, work late, and strike oil. ","We just want to win. Thats the bottom line. I think a lot of times people may become content with one championship or a little bit of success, but we dont really reflect on what weve done in the past. We focus on the present. ","The success of Watermark surprised me. I never thought of music as something commercial; it was something very personal to me. ","I dont understand why people whose entire lives or their corporate success depends on communication, and yet they are led on occasion by CEOs who cannot talk their way out of a paper bag and dont care to. ","The secrets of success are a good wife and a steady job. My wife told me. ","Its both rebellion and conformity that attack you with success. ","When one has success, the answer is not to undo that success. It is to continue what has been done. ","Success is hard in general for most women. We now have such busy lives, and were told we can do everything - you know, we can have the relationship and the marriage and the kids and the career. ","My first attempt at a kiss was in fifth grade, but it didnt go so well. Later, I used Boyz II Men and Jodeci songs to come on to girls. I had more success. ","Success means having the courage, the determination, and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be. ","I thought doing reality TV would be the greatest success of my life or the biggest mistake. ","We create success or failure on the course primarily by our thoughts. ","Once you can accept failure, you can have fun and success. ","Success for an athlete follows many years of hard work and dedication. ","When everything happens to you when youre so young, youre very lucky, but by the same token, youre never going to have that same feeling again. The first time anything happens to you - your first love, your first success - the second one is never the same. ","Success sometimes can really bite you in the shorts. ","With success came an ever-growing burden of responsibility. I lived with a near-constant low-level anxiety that I would make a mistake that would not only threaten my career, but also my brothers - not to mention the livelihoods of many people who work with us or for us. ","Sometimes people take it for granted that they had success, especially nowadays when you have instant stardom. A lot of people feel entitlement and nobody is entitled to anything. ","Winning in Afghanistan is having a country that is stable enough to ensure that there is no safe haven for Al Qaida or for a militant Taliban that welcomes Al Qaida. Thats really the measure of success for the United States. ","Success comes in waves. ","I dont dwell on success. Maybe thats one reason Im successful. ","Yes I have made a lot of money and I have a lot of respect, my films have done well, and I know there are loads of loads of people who look up to me and really love me. I really just thought this is like a strange dream. I have never thought this is a success - I dont have a standard. ","To me, success is choice and opportunity. ","Nothing reinforces a professional relationship more than enjoying success with someone. ","Whether in success or in failure, Im proud of every single movie Ive ever directed. ","Ive had great success being a total idiot. ","People think your success is just a matter of having a pretty face. But its easy to be chewed up and spat out. Youve got to stay ahead of the game to be able to stay in it. ","I was trying to uphold what I thought feminism was as best I could by supporting women, by trying to create an opportunity to get women to get together, play music together and celebrate the fact that we are having great success making music on our own and together. ","Writers, as they gain success, feel like outsiders because writers dont come together in real groups. ","First-person narrators is the way I know how to write a book with the greatest power and chance of artistic success. ","I think that the entertainment industry itself has a history of chasing success. Any time a hit product comes out, all the other companies start chasing after that success and trying to recreate it by putting out similar products. ","It would be a joy for me if someone who was working with me became a big success. ","Being best is a false goal, you have to measure success on your own terms. ","I was born with success. Lucky for me I am able to handle it. Also, I damn well deserve it! ","Major success feels a bit like a coronation. Like Id become a king. I was one of the most famous people in the world, loved and hated in equal measure. I couldnt see anything bad with it. It made me a happy person. ","I think that everybody in the world, whatever colour or creed, has a jerk like JR in his or her family somewhere. Whether it is a father, uncle, cousin or brother, everybody can identify with JR and that certainly had something to do with the success of Dallas. ","I did not become successful in my work through embracing or engaging in celebrity culture. I never signed away my privacy in exchange for success. ","My ambition was to stop waiting tables. That was how I measured success: finally, I was able to stop waiting tables, and I was able to pay the rent, and that was by being a stand-up comic. Not a very good stand-up comic, but good enough to make a living. ","Success is a journey, not a destination. ","Hosting a TV show is a full-time job in which success is defined by it never ending. ","Success breeds success. ","I had a lot of success from the start. I never really was tested for long periods of time. I got my first professional job while I was a senior in college. I signed with the William Morris Agency before I graduated. ","As his partner on this amazing journey, I can tell you Mitt Romney was not handed success. He built it. ","Im glad that my parents missed one thing that was really unbelievable. They saw me hit this great success. It was a blast and we had a lot of laughs. And it was just an amazing time. They passed away. And then after I got, you know, famous, all these haters came out of nowhere. ","My literary success meant nothing to me. ","I owe a large part of my success to Joe Brown, who helped me both as a player and a person. ","Everyone applauds each others success in Hollywood because they know how tough it is, but it really comes down fundamentally to the process. ","All these people who say success changes people; well, no, it just magnifies whats there. ","The secret of our success is that we never, never give up. ","One might think that the money value of an invention constitutes its reward to the man who loves his work. But... I continue to find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the work that precedes what the world calls success. ","I find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the work that precedes what the world calls success. ","It is not the possession of truth, but the success which attends the seeking after it, that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him. ","Success will always be measured by the extent to which we serve the buying public. ","Ive had a lot of success over the years racing in New York, but the main point is that I feel the marathon is a different event, a lot more my event. ","We now live in a world where the only thing to have is success, but failure is marvelous. Its fertiliser, its like living fertiliser, because youre forced on yourself. ","For me, I dont feel it is a success in the career to be the pretty woman; career success comes from being characters who tell us something about the truth. ","In the music industry, we value large success. I realized that while I would like that, that its not what my writing is about. And if I start making it about that, it becomes impure. ","I know a lot of people who have tremendous commercial success and they go directly for it. Theres something that has always been difficult about that for me. ","Some people really trip on success or popularity. My friends would talk to me about that, about tripping on all this stuff, but you know what I tripped on? I started buying property. ","The road to success is not easy to navigate, but with hard work, drive and passion, its possible to achieve the American dream. ","My story of success and failure is not just about music and being famous. Its about living and loving and trying to find purpose in this crazy world. ","The most successful men in the end are those whose success is the result of steady accretion. ","Were not uncomfortable with it, and weve already been through enough of the music business where Im not really worried that commercial success is going to in some way - were already past saving, you know what I mean? Its too late for us. ","Although in skating you compete with other people, anyone who achieves a certain level of success is first and foremost competing against themselves. And for me the idea that I could always do better, learn more, learn faster, is something that came from skating. But I carried that with me for the rest of my life. ","I know of no single formula for success. But over the years I have observed that some attributes of leadership are universal and are often about finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration to work together. ","My definition of success is control. ","The secret of my success is my hairspray. ","You should put time into learning your craft. It seems like people want success so quickly, way before theyre ready. ","If you come into success too soon, youll burn out and be finished before you know it. If you let the maturation process happen naturally, youll be happier with yourself in the end. ","I dont know if its naivete or just narcissism, but I start out with this notion that I can do anything. Its not until I get into it that I realize what Ive thrown myself into, and then I will do anything not to humiliate myself. And that, I think, is the secret to my success. ","My wife Elizabeth and I started The Really Terrible Orchestra for people like us who are pretty hopeless musicians who would like to play in an orchestra. It has been a great success. We give performances; weve become the most famous bad orchestra in the world. ","I think people in Botswana are pleased that my books paint a positive picture of their lives and portray the country as being very special. Theyve made a great success of their country, and the people are fed up with the constant reporting of only the problems and poverty of the continent. They welcome something which puts the positive side. ","Thats the key to success, isnt it? It has to be fun. ","Ive learned that success comes in a very prickly package. Whether you choose to accept it or not is up to you. ","The manic pursuit of success cost me everything I could love: my wife, my three children, some friends I would have liked to grow old with. ","The success of the Rat Pack or the Clan was due to the camaraderie, the three guys who work together and kid each other and love each other. ","Real success is not on the stage, but off the stage as a human being, and how you get along with your fellow man. ","I realise that I do not change the course of history. I am an actor, I do a movie, thats the end of it. You have to realise we are just clowns for hire. After I had success it was great, at first, not to worry about money. It was on my mind when I was growing up. ","Without imagination we can go nowhere. And imagination is not restricted to the arts. Every scientist I have met who has been a success has had to imagine. ","I feel true success comes from being able to work and the love for it. ","People repeat behaviour that leads to flooding their brains with pleasurable chemicals. The short-term reward loop acts over hours to years, and the long-term reproductive success loop over generations. ","With the success of the last three or so years, when a lot of people start treating you differently, theres a danger that you may start to think of yourself differently. You rely on your friends to say, Hey, wake up! ","I came from a family where I felt great pressure to be financially successful, and I felt that staying in Chicago and doing theater, I was, in all likelihood, not going to find financial success. ","I used to think that losing made you more hungry and determined but after my success at the Olympics and the U.S. Open I realise that winning is the biggest motivation. ","Theres that unwritten schism that literary writers get all the awards and commericals writers get all the success. ","The vampire was a complete change from the usual romantic characters I was playing, but it was a success. ","Excess is success. ","Sometimes, because of my success, I am afraid that I was not a good father. With the first two I was too strong, and with the other three I was too weak. ","More people on unemployment benefits is not success in America, fewer people on not because we kicked them off but because they have been able to get a job in the private sector, because government got out of the way. ","I think most people believe success in government is how many fewer people are in government, not because you kick them off of benefits like unemployment but theyve been able to control their own destiny because private sector employers have created more jobs. ","Independent films have a very different cachet than success films. ","Singing is my dream and, while it may have not been a commercial success, critically I was thrilled with the reception my first album got. ","It was very clear to me in 1965, in Mississippi, that, as a lawyer, I could get people into schools, desegregate the schools, but if they were kicked off the plantations - and if they didnt have food, didnt have jobs, didnt have health care, didnt have the means to exercise those civil rights, we were not going to have success. ","Success and failure are equally disastrous. ","Luxury is the wolf at the door and its fangs are the vanities and conceits germinated by success. When an artist learns this, he knows where the danger is. ","Temporary success can be achieved in spite of lack of other fundamental qualities, but no advancements can be maintained without hard work. ","Im sure not afraid of success and Ive learned not to be afraid of failure. The only thing Im afraid of now is of being someone I dont like much. ","I dont like Tommy on Broadway at all. I like the music, Im pleased with Petes success but I dont like what theyve done to it. ","Eastern Muslim countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, are relative success stories, as they are not afflicted by the Arab heritage of retreat and humiliation at the hands of the French, Spanish, British, Turks, and Persians. ","The FHAs success provides strong evidence that government can and should play a role in the nations mortgage finance system. It also demonstrates that although government intervention in the economy during the Great Recession was messy, things would have been a lot messier without it. ","After all, youre not exactly a nation like all the other nations. You are unique, if only because you are such an ancient people, and because of the way you are spread all over the world and your obvious success in many fields. ","My success is not due to any personal superiority over other people. ","The negative side of the American Dream comes when people pursue success at any cost, which in turn destroys the vision and the dream. ","Once you achieve a certain level of success or fame, it becomes really difficult to go against type. ","I realize that Facebook today is a global success with more than 600 million users worldwide. But I also understand, maybe a bit sadly, that it is not for me. Perhaps it is because I am a bit too old? Or perhaps it is because I am more interested in exploring the epic text, which I have lived with for all my life. ","No man is a success in business unless he loves his work. ","It was a way out of poverty. It was a way to success. It was a way to education. And it was a way to a brighter day for me. ","To this day, most people think of me as the fastest human. They dont really think me as a long jumper, although thats the event I had more success in. ","There is no correlation between a childhood success and a professional athlete. ","Mass communication, radio, and especially television, have attempted, not without success, to annihilate every possibility of solitude and reflection. ","Success is very ephemeral. You depend entirely on the desire of others, which makes it difficult to relax. ","For anyone whos been in care, successfully coming through the system is nothing to with money or success; its the ability to feel love and be loved in return. ","You know, you want to be a success. You want people to know who you are. ","Everyone has a warped vision of Hollywood and what success in Hollywood is like. ","Id always fantasized about writing a new play. Even when I had all this success in television, what I was daydreaming about in my dressing room is that one day I would do it. ","The success of Scrubs allowed me to pursue anything I felt passionately about without having to worry about money. It allowed me to spend my summer work shopping my show at a nonprofit theater. ","If greater openness is a key to economic success, I believe there is increasingly a need for openness in the political sphere as well. ","I cant imagine wanting to be famous just for the sake of being famous. I think fame should come along with success, talent. ","There are so few women in general who arent completely threatened and confused by other womens success. Its very disappointing. ","Sometimes success comes in ways you dont expect. ","Thanks to the success of Henning Mankell and Peter Hoeg, there wasnt the same stigma attached to writing genre thrillers in Scandinavia as there was in many other cultures. Quite the opposite, in fact. ","But I like not these great success of yours; for I know how jealous are the gods. ","Dullness in matters of government is a good sign, and not a bad one - in particular, dullness in parliamentary government is a test of its excellence, an indication of its success. ","Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of the air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success. ","Elegance is not a dispensable luxury but a factor that decides between success and failure. ","One of the things I realized... is how few success stories there are in websites or products or businesses that exist primarily for an altruistic purpose. ","There are over 2,000 direct clones of the Groupon business model. However, theres an equal amount of proof that the barriers to success are enormous. In spite of all those competitors, only a handful are remotely relevant. ","I think all those people I did stories about measured their own success by the joy their work was giving them. ","Im in the studio 24 hours a day. Its true that once you get a certain level of success, you become a target. Talk magazine should be ashamed of themselves. ","If you can attribute your success entirely to your own mental effort, to your own attitude, to some spiritual essence that you have that is better than other peoples, then that must feel pretty good. ","I had come to the point when I realized it was unlikely that my film career was going to move beyond a certain level of role. And I was - because I had graphic instances of it - handicapped by the success of Star Trek. A director would say, I dont want Jean-Luc Picard in my movie - and this was compounded by X-Men as well. ","In my forties, my optimism was boundless. I had really good health and tremendous success which allowed me to do anything I wanted. ","For the past few years, I was the more visible Asian performer, and I think it gave young girls a kind of role model showing its possible to actually reach success doing movies. ","And really, the basis, I think, of achieving some success in what I want to do today comes from my mothers push to get me to read and to make something of myself from the standpoint of an education. ","Ive always been too hard on myself to behave like Ive arrived or even to enjoy whatever success Ive had. Ive always envisioned myself higher than where I was and I still do. With each success I think, Thats nice but Im supposed to go there! ","Sudden success in golf is like the sudden acquisition of wealth. It is apt to unsettle and deteriorate the character. ","If you want to have great success, youd better give them what they want, but so be it. ","I am involved with Write Girl, which is such a great organization, because they go into inner city schools and work with underprivileged girls to pair them up with other writers. And it gets them learning to express themselves and become familiar with their own voice. They have a 100% success ratio getting those girls into college. ","Its hard for childrens authors to be accepted when they try to write adult books. J.K. Rowling is the exception because people are so eager to read anything by her, but it took Judy Blume three or four tries before she had a success. ","Other peoples success spurs me on to do well and gives me motivation. ","Women face enough pressures and challenges in a workplace that is still depressingly biased against a females success. Add to that, the fact that the very thing many women I know find most rewarding (having kids) is now frowned upon. ","The only success worth ones powder was success in the line of ones idiosyncrasy... what was talent but the art of being completely whatever one happened to be? ","Im an eternal realist and the success rate for being an actor is pretty low. ","Your chances of success are directly proportional to the degree of pleasure you desire from what you do. If you are in a job you hate, face the fact squarely and get out. ","Success is the person who year after year reaches the highest limits in his field. ","The success of Torn was a bit too much for me. I took a year off and was still scared to start the second album. ","Well, the crazy thing for me is I think out of anything thats happened in the last year, all the success, people always ask what do you guys do with the money? I dont think they realize were not really making any money. ","Some Internet operators are concerned that video services such as Netflix and YouTube consume lots of the bandwidth on the network. While there is some truth to this, my guess is that the operators wished they could provide the same kind of services with the same success as Netflix and YouTube. ","Every success in limiting armaments is a sign that the will to achieve mutual understanding exists, and every such success thus supports the fight for international law and order. ","I think that my biggest attribute to any success that I have had is hard work. There really is no substitute for working hard. ","Girlfriend and 100 Percent Fun were my two peeks, around 92 and 96. The reality is that the times I had the most media success, sold lots of records and played bigger shows, I had the least control of my own life. ","The aim of life is to live, and to live means to be aware, joyously, drunkenly, serenely, divinely aware. ","Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air, is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies. ","I have found that if you love life, life will love you back. ","Life becomes harder for us when we live for others, but it also becomes richer and happier. ","Beware the barrenness of a busy life. ","A healthful hunger for a great idea is the beauty and blessedness of life. ","When I hear somebody sigh, Life is hard, I am always tempted to ask, Compared to what? ","Begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life. ","What we think determines what happens to us, so if we want to change our lives, we need to stretch our minds. ","Fortunately analysis is not the only way to resolve inner conflicts. Life itself still remains a very effective therapist. ","Look, I dont want to wax philosophic, but I will say that if youre alive youve got to flap your arms and legs, youve got to jump around a lot, for life is the very opposite of death, and therefore you must at very least think noisy and colorfully, or youre not alive. ","Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot. ","May you live all the days of your life. ","Doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life. ","A well-spent day brings happy sleep. ","The story of life is quicker then the blink of an eye, the story of love is hello, goodbye. ","Get correct views of life, and learn to see the world in its true light. It will enable you to live pleasantly, to do good, and, when summoned away, to leave without regret. ","To live a pure unselfish life, one must count nothing as ones own in the midst of abundance. ","Life is half spent before we know what it is. ","Life is a long lesson in humility. ","You have succeeded in life when all you really want is only what you really need. ","My life is my message. ","Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity, or registering wrongs. ","While theres life, theres hope. ","I look back on my life like a good days work, it was done and I am satisfied with it. ","Once you say youre going to settle for second, thats what happens to you in life. ","The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing. ","The purpose of life is a life of purpose. ","Use your health, even to the point of wearing it out. That is what it is for. Spend all you have before you die; do not outlive yourself. ","Maybe all one can do is hope to end up with the right regrets. ","The courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment; but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy. ","Not life, but good life, is to be chiefly valued. ","Kindness, Ive discovered, is everything in life. ","Life is never easy for those who dream. ","What is important in life is life, and not the result of life. ","The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes. ","People living deeply have no fear of death. ","The chief danger in life is that you may take too many precautions. ","An aim in life is the only fortune worth finding. ","We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life. ","The greatest pleasure of life is love. ","If you live long enough, youll make mistakes. But if you learn from them, youll be a better person. Its how you handle adversity, not how it affects you. The main thing is never quit, never quit, never quit. ","There is just one life for each of us: our own. ","Life will always be to a large extent what we ourselves make it. ","Life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh. ","We cant plan life. All we can do is be available for it. ","Life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about. ","Life loves the liver of it. ","Life is too short to work so hard. ","Unbeing dead isnt being alive. ","Life is pleasant. Death is peaceful. Its the transition thats troublesome. ","Life isnt a matter of milestones, but of moments. ","Life is a succession of moments, to live each one is to succeed. ","The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge. ","To change ones life: Start immediately. Do it flamboyantly. ","This life is worth living, we can say, since it is what we make it. ","The indispensable first step to getting the things you want out of life is this: decide what you want. ","While we are postponing, life speeds by. ","The art of life is to know how to enjoy a little and to endure very much. ","Life is something to do when you cant get to sleep. ","To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts. ","There is only one difference between a long life and a good dinner: that, in the dinner, the sweets come last. ","I take a simple view of life. It is keep your eyes open and get on with it. ","For the happiest life, days should be rigorously planned, nights left open to chance. ","I take care of my flowers and my cats. And enjoy food. And thats living. ","With the past, I have nothing to do; nor with the future. I live now. ","The great use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it. ","Life is like a trumpet - if you dont put anything into it, you dont get anything out of it. ","The most exhausting thing in life is being insincere. ","Every man regards his own life as the New Years Eve of time. ","Give me the luxuries of life and I will willingly do without the necessities. ","What a wonderful life Ive had! I only wish Id realized it sooner. ","Life has meaning only if one barters it day by day for something other than itself. ","The man who has no inner-life is a slave to his surroundings. ","Life well spent is long. ","Life is largely a matter of expectation. ","Life must be lived as play. ","My life is every moment of my life. It is not a culmination of the past. ","The main facts in human life are five: birth, food, sleep, love and death. ","Wrong life cannot be lived rightly. ","A chain is no stronger than its weakest link, and life is after all a chain. ","No man is a failure who is enjoying life. ","Life consists in what a man is thinking of all day. ","Life is wasted on the living. ","Life is a moderately good play with a badly written third act. ","Life in abundance comes only through great love. ","There is no wealth but life. ","If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor. ","Life is anything that dies when you stomp on it. ","Life is not an exact science, it is an art. ","I did not direct my life. I didnt design it. I never made decisions. Things always came up and made them for me. Thats what life is. ","To live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often. ","Our business in life is not to succeed, but to continue to fail in good spirits. ","Our entire life - consists ultimately in accepting ourselves as we are. ","The basic fact about human existence is not that it is a tragedy, but that it is a bore. It is not so much a war as an endless standing in line. ","One way to get the most out of life is to look upon it as an adventure. ","When life is too easy for us, we must beware or we may not be ready to meet the blows which sooner or later come to everyone, rich or poor. ","Life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises. ","To live is so startling it leaves little time for anything else. ","Life is but thought. ","To me, if life boils down to one thing, its movement. To live is to keep moving. ","Wars and elections are both too big and too small to matter in the long run. The daily work - that goes on, it adds up. ","Seventy percent of success in life is showing up. ","Life is much shorter than I imagined it to be. ","Life itself is the proper binge. ","To know nothing is the happiest life. ","The whole secret of life is to be interested in one thing profoundly and in a thousand things well. ","You dont have to be the Dalai Lama to tell people that lifes about change. ","We are all here for a spell, get all the good laughs you can. ","Life ought to be a struggle of desire toward adventures whose nobility will fertilize the soul. ","The Indian Summer of life should be a little sunny and a little sad, like the season, and infinite in wealth and depth of tone, but never hustled. ","Any life is made up of a single moment, the moment in which a man finds out, once and for all, who he is. ","Human life is as evanescent as the morning dew or a flash of lightning. ","Varietys the very spice of life, That gives it all its flavor. ","The less routine the more life. ","To be free is to have achieved your life. ","Not a shred of evidence exists in favor of the idea that life is serious. ","Life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating. ","What we play is life. ","Life is a great sunrise. I do not see why death should not be an even greater one. ","The fear of life is the favorite disease of the 20th century. ","Life is a culmination of the past, an awareness of the present, an indication of a future beyond knowledge, the quality that gives a touch of divinity to matter. ","Life has a higher end, than to be amused. ","The person lives twice who lives the first life well. ","Unrest of spirit is a mark of life. ","Life itself still remains a very effective therapist. ","I have inspiration and feelings of being alive most every day I live. ","Life is a lot like jazz... its best when you improvise. ","I had no blood relatives till I made some. ","Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead. ","I believe that if life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade... And try to find somebody whose life has given them vodka, and have a party. ","Life is one big road with lots of signs. So when you riding through the ruts, dont complicate your mind. Flee from hate, mischief and jealousy. Dont bury your thoughts, put your vision to reality. Wake Up and Live! ","Ive missed more than 9000 shots in my career. Ive lost almost 300 games. 26 times, Ive been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. Ive failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. ","Where there is love there is life. ","If you dont design your own life plan, chances are youll fall into someone elses plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much. ","I hated every minute of training, but I said, Dont quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion. ","In everyones life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit. ","You have enemies? Good. That means youve stood up for something, sometime in your life. ","Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. ","Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success. ","Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive. ","Your time is limited, so dont waste it living someone elses life. Dont be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other peoples thinking. Dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. ","Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you cant help them, at least dont hurt them. ","Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life. ","In the end, its not the years in your life that count. Its the life in your years. ","Choosing to be positive and having a grateful attitude is going to determine how youre going to live your life. ","Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky. ","Ive failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed. ","Character develops itself in the stream of life. ","Life is a mirror and will reflect back to the thinker what he thinks into it. ","Life has its own hidden forces which you can only discover by living. ","My mother was the most beautiful woman I ever saw. All I am I owe to my mother. I attribute all my success in life to the moral, intellectual and physical education I received from her. ","I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living, its a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope. Which is what I do, and that enables you to laugh at lifes realities. ","I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isnt, than live my life as if there isnt and die to find out there is. ","Every moment and every event of every mans life on earth plants something in his soul. ","For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today? And whenever the answer has been No for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. ","Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Dont wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether its at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored. ","Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another. ","Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness, immobilized by the gravity of my loss, or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I have - life itself. ","But friendship is precious, not only in the shade, but in the sunshine of life, and thanks to a benevolent arrangement the greater part of life is sunshine. ","When you rise in the morning, give thanks for the light, for your life, for your strength. Give thanks for your food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason to give thanks, the fault lies in yourself. ","No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life well ever see on this earth! ","Imagine all the people living life in peace. You may say Im a dreamer, but Im not the only one. I hope someday youll join us, and the world will be as one. ","Im not going to change the way I look or the way I feel to conform to anything. Ive always been a freak. So Ive been a freak all my life and I have to live with that, you know. Im one of those people. ","If you can dream it, then you can achieve it. You will get all you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want. ","Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. ","Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity. ","All changes, even the most longed for, have their melancholy; for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves; we must die to one life before we can enter another. ","God gave us the gift of life; it is up to us to give ourselves the gift of living well. ","Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome. ","Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing. ","All life demands struggle. Those who have everything given to them become lazy, selfish, and insensitive to the real values of life. The very striving and hard work that we so constantly try to avoid is the major building block in the person we are today. ","Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around. ","Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. ","Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young. ","Without music, life would be a mistake. ","Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens. ","Again, you cant connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. ","Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Lifes longing for itself. They came through you but not from you and though they are with you yet they belong not to you. ","People fear death even more than pain. Its strange that they fear death. Life hurts a lot more than death. At the point of death, the pain is over. Yeah, I guess it is a friend. ","Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything. ","Its the game of life. Do I win or do I lose? One day theyre gonna shut the game down. I gotta have as much fun and go around the board as many times as I can before its my turn to leave. ","I love being married. Its so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life. ","I cannot even imagine where I would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy. Lets face it, friends make life a lot more fun. ","Ive learned that you shouldnt go through life with a catchers mitt on both hands; you need to be able to throw something back. ","If you always put limit on everything you do, physical or anything else. It will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. ","You cant stop loving or wanting to love because when its right its the best thing in the world. When youre in a relationship and its good, even if nothing else in your life is right, you feel like your whole world is complete. ","Achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life, and that happiness, not pain or mindless self-indulgence, is the proof of your moral integrity, since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values. ","Lifes most persistent and urgent question is, What are you doing for others? ","Love is life. And if you miss love, you miss life. ","The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own. You do not blame them on your mother, the ecology, or the president. You realize that you control your own destiny. ","Life is tough, but its tougher when youre stupid. ","All the adversity Ive had in my life, all my troubles and obstacles, have strengthened me... You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you. ","An armed society is a polite society. Manners are good when one may have to back up his acts with his life. ","The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. ","If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough. ","Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend to them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again. ","Learning to trust is one of lifes most difficult tasks. ","Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement. ","In our daily life, we encounter people who are angry, deceitful, intent only on satisfying their own needs. There is so much anger, distrust, greed, and pettiness that we are losing our capacity to work well together. ","Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. Because its only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential. ","Of lifes two chief prizes, beauty and truth, I found the first in a loving heart and the second in a laborers hand. ","Dont Make Assumptions. Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life. ","The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate. ","All my life, my heart has yearned for a thing I cannot name. ","The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each others life. ","Whatever your lifes work is, do it well. A man should do his job so well that the living, the dead, and the unborn could do it no better. ","The things that will destroy America are prosperity-at-any-price, peace-at-any-price, safety-first instead of duty-first, the love of soft living, and the get-rich-quick theory of life. ","Our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us, but is always the result of a good conscience, good health, occupation, and freedom in all just pursuits. ","To be idle is a short road to death and to be diligent is a way of life; foolish people are idle, wise people are diligent. ","If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with success unexpected in common hours. ","In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, dont try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present. ","The secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you. If you do that, youre in control of your life. If you dont, life controls you. ","Each person must live their life as a model for others. ","You cant connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. ","I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when Im awake, you know? ","Through humor, you can soften some of the worst blows that life delivers. And once you find laughter, no matter how painful your situation might be, you can survive it. ","We love life, not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving. ","We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light. ","You can have everything in life you want, if you will just help other people get what they want. ","A man who views the world the same at fifty as he did at twenty has wasted thirty years of his life. ","Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. Its perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes weve learned something from yesterday. ","There are four questions of value in life... What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for? The answer to each is the same. Only love. ","I dont believe in guilt, I believe in living on impulse as long as you never intentionally hurt another person, and dont judge people in your life. I think you should live completely free. ","Life stands before me like an eternal spring with new and brilliant clothes. ","Just as a candle cannot burn without fire, men cannot live without a spiritual life. ","The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved; loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves. ","He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life. ","Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained. ","Life is full of beauty. Notice it. Notice the bumble bee, the small child, and the smiling faces. Smell the rain, and feel the wind. Live your life to the fullest potential, and fight for your dreams. ","I am convinced that material things can contribute a lot to making ones life pleasant, but, basically, if you do not have very good friends and relatives who matter to you, life will be really empty and sad and material things cease to be important. ","As you walk down the fairway of life you must smell the roses, for you only get to play one round. ","The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls. ","When I was young I thought that money was the most important thing in life; now that I am old I know that it is. ","Remembering that Ill be dead soon is the most important tool Ive ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. ","There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning. ","Lifes Tragedy is that we get old to soon and wise too late. ","The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature. ","Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you havent found it yet, keep looking. Dont settle. As with all matters of the heart, youll know when you find it. ","Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. ","You change your life by changing your heart. ","I believe that being successful means having a balance of success stories across the many areas of your life. You cant truly be considered successful in your business life if your home life is in shambles. ","It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power. ","Im the one that has to die when its time for me to die, so let me live my life, the way I want to. ","True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us. ","We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give. ","Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit. ","True friendship multiplies the good in life and divides its evils. Strive to have friends, for life without friends is like life on a desert island... to find one real friend in a lifetime is good fortune; to keep him is a blessing. ","The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time. ","Money isnt the most important thing in life, but its reasonably close to oxygen on the gotta have it scale. ","Make it a habit to tell people thank you. To express your appreciation, sincerely and without the expectation of anything in return. Truly appreciate those around you, and youll soon find many others around you. Truly appreciate life, and youll find that you have more of it. ","Today I choose life. Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices - today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it. ","Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you. ","If you ask me what I came into this life to do, I will tell you: I came to live out loud. ","I remember my mothers prayers and they have always followed me. They have clung to me all my life. ","A sense of humor... is needed armor. Joy in ones heart and some laughter on ones lips is a sign that the person down deep has a pretty good grasp of life. ","You can change your world by changing your words... Remember, death and life are in the power of the tongue. ","The Christian life is not a constant high. I have my moments of deep discouragement. I have to go to God in prayer with tears in my eyes, and say, O God, forgive me, or Help me. ","Theres no tragedy in life like the death of a child. Things never get back to the way they were. ","Today, more than ever before, life must be characterized by a sense of Universal responsibility, not only nation to nation and human to human, but also human to other forms of life. ","You will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love. ","Learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself, and know that everything in life has purpose. There are no mistakes, no coincidences, all events are blessings given to us to learn from. ","If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life. ","Without pain, there would be no suffering, without suffering we would never learn from our mistakes. To make it right, pain and suffering is the key to all windows, without it, there is no way of life. ","Imagination is everything. It is the preview of lifes coming attractions. ","Presents dont really mean much to me. I dont want to sound mawkish, but - it was the realization that I have a great many people in my life who really love me, and who I really love. ","One of the things I learned the hard way was that it doesnt pay to get discouraged. Keeping busy and making optimism a way of life can restore your faith in yourself. ","There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living. ","It was once said that the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped. ","Life is hard; its harder if youre stupid. ","The great danger for family life, in the midst of any society whose idols are pleasure, comfort and independence, lies in the fact that people close their hearts and become selfish. ","Football is like life - it requires perseverance, self-denial, hard work, sacrifice, dedication and respect for authority. ","Just as treasures are uncovered from the earth, so virtue appears from good deeds, and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind. To walk safely through the maze of human life, one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue. ","Once in his life, every man is entitled to fall madly in love with a gorgeous redhead. ","There are only three things women need in life: food, water, and compliments. ","My life has been one great big joke, a dance thats walked a song thats spoke, I laugh so hard I almost choke when I think about myself. ","Nothing is perfect. Life is messy. Relationships are complex. Outcomes are uncertain. People are irrational. ","Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing. ","And this, our life, exempt from public haunt, finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones, and good in everything. ","Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it. This is a kind of death. ","So long as the memory of certain beloved friends lives in my heart, I shall say that life is good. ","Life isnt about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself. ","The devil has put a penalty on all things we enjoy in life. Either we suffer in health or we suffer in soul or we get fat. ","There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures. ","Every mans life ends the same way. It is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another. ","A man who has never made a woman angry is a failure in life. ","Life is pretty simple: You do some stuff. Most fails. Some works. You do more of what works. If it works big, others quickly copy it. Then you do something else. The trick is the doing something else. ","Holding on to anger, resentment and hurt only gives you tense muscles, a headache and a sore jaw from clenching your teeth. Forgiveness gives you back the laughter and the lightness in your life. ","Those who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce them; for these only gave them life, those the art of living well. ","Life is a series of experiences, each one of which makes us bigger, even though sometimes it is hard to realize this. For the world was built to develop character, and we must learn that the setbacks and grieves which we endure help us in our marching onward. ","Before success comes in any mans life, hes sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps some failures. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit. Thats exactly what the majority of men do. ","Life is a gamble. You can get hurt, but people die in plane crashes, lose their arms and legs in car accidents; people die every day. Same with fighters: some die, some get hurt, some go on. You just dont let yourself believe it will happen to you. ","Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself. ","You may not always have a comfortable life and you will not always be able to solve all of the worlds problems at once but dont ever underestimate the importance you can have because history has shown us that courage can be contagious and hope can take on a life of its own. ","One reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus; we never concentrate our power. Most people dabble their way through life, never deciding to master anything in particular. ","Each player must accept the cards life deals him or her: but once they are in hand, he or she alone must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game. ","Three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for. ","Life is hard. After all, it kills you. ","There is only one thing in life worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. ","There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it. ","I never thought of losing, but now that it s happened, the only thing is to do it right. Thats my obligation to all the people who believe in me. We all have to take defeats in life. ","At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, or a parent. ","The greatest gift of life is friendship, and I have received it. ","You do things when the opportunities come along. Ive had periods in my life when Ive had a bundle of ideas come along, and Ive had long dry spells. If I get an idea next week, Ill do something. If not, I wont do a damn thing. ","You have to take risks. We will only understand the miracle of life fully when we allow the unexpected to happen. ","My family, frankly, they werent folks who went to church every week. My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she didnt raise me in the church, so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead. ","We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ","Life is hard. Then you die. Then they throw dirt in your face. Then the worms eat you. Be grateful it happens in that order. ","Stop acting as if life is a rehearsal. Live this day as if it were your last. The past is over and gone. The future is not guaranteed. ","The greatest day in your life and mine is when we take total responsibility for our attitudes. Thats the day we truly grow up. ","You want to believe that theres one relationship in life thats beyond betrayal. A relationship thats beyond that kind of hurt. And there isnt. ","I decided, very early on, just to accept life unconditionally; I never expected it to do anything special for me, yet I seemed to accomplish far more than I had ever hoped. Most of the time it just happened to me without my ever seeking it. ","I want to live my life so that my nights are not full of regrets. ","Its true, Christmas can feel like a lot of work, particularly for mothers. But when you look back on all the Christmases in your life, youll find youve created family traditions and lasting memories. Those memories, good and bad, are really what help to keep a family together over the long haul. ","An Atheist believes that a hospital should be built instead of a church. An atheist believes that deed must be done instead of prayer said. An atheist strives for involvement in life and not escape into death. He wants disease conquered, poverty vanished, war eliminated. ","Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death! ","March on. Do not tarry. To go forward is to move toward perfection. March on, and fear not the thorns, or the sharp stones on lifes path. ","Many of lifes failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up. ","Some of the worst mistakes of my life have been haircuts. ","To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded. ","No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven dont want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Lifes change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. ","Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country. ","Have courage for the great sorrows of life and patience for the small ones; and when you have laboriously accomplished your daily task, go to sleep in peace. ","Friendship is the shadow of the evening, which increases with the setting sun of life. ","Waste your money and youre only out of money, but waste your time and youve lost a part of your life. ","A life is either all spiritual or not spiritual at all. No man can serve two masters. Your life is shaped by the end you live for. You are made in the image of what you desire. ","Being in control of your life and having realistic expectations about your day-to-day challenges are the keys to stress management, which is perhaps the most important ingredient to living a happy, healthy and rewarding life. ","When his life was ruined, his family killed, his farm destroyed, Job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens, Why god? Why me? and the thundering voice of God answered, Theres just something about you that pisses me off. ","My favorite things in life dont cost any money. Its really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time. ","I am a woman in process. Im just trying like everybody else. I try to take every conflict, every experience, and learn from it. Life is never dull. ","A womans life can really be a succession of lives, each revolving around some emotionally compelling situation or challenge, and each marked off by some intense experience. ","We can always choose to perceive things differently. You can focus on whats wrong in your life, or you can focus on whats right. ","The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering. ","Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking. ","As we advance in life it becomes more and more difficult, but in fighting the difficulties the inmost strength of the heart is developed. ","Choose your lifes mate carefully. From this one decision will come 90 percent of all your happiness or misery. ","Life is divided into three terms - that which was, which is, and which will be. Let us learn from the past to profit by the present, and from the present, to live better in the future. ","The quality, not the longevity, of ones life is what is important. ","Are you bored with life? Then throw yourself into some work you believe in with all your heart, live for it, die for it, and you will find happiness that you had thought could never be yours. ","I swear, by my life and my love of it, that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine. ","There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist, or accept the responsibility for changing them. ","Ships that pass in the night, and speak each other in passing, only a signal shown, and a distant voice in the darkness; So on the ocean of life, we pass and speak one another, only a look and a voice, then darkness again and a silence. ","I guess I have always been deeply terrified to really be someones wife since I know from life one cannot love another, ever, really. ","I cant really change my life to accommodate people who are jealous. I dont see why I should. ","The more sand has escaped from the hourglass of our life, the clearer we should see through it. ","Life was always a matter of waiting for the right moment to act. ","You must understand the whole of life, not just one little part of it. That is why you must read, that is why you must look at the skies, that is why you must sing and dance, and write poems and suffer and understand, for all that is life. ","If you plan on being anything less than you are capable of being, you will probably be unhappy all the days of your life. ","Life is thickly sown with thorns, and I know no other remedy than to pass quickly through them. The longer we dwell on our misfortunes, the greater is their power to harm us. ","The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins? ","Life is the art of drawing without an eraser. ","Im back to doing everything I used to, loving life as ever. ","Life would be infinitely happier if we could only be born at the age of eighty and gradually approach eighteen. ","As you simplify your life, the laws of the universe will be simpler; solitude will not be solitude, poverty will not be poverty, nor weakness weakness. ","One secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes. ","The true object of all human life is play. Earth is a task garden; heaven is a playground. ","I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed. ","Success comes from taking the initiative and following up... persisting... eloquently expressing the depth of your love. What simple action could you take today to produce a new momentum toward success in your life? ","I think its important to have closure in any relationship that ends - from a romantic relationship to a friendship. You should always have a sense of clarity at the end and know why it began and why it ended. You need that in your life to move cleanly into your next phase. ","One life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it. But to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief, that is a fate more terrible than dying. ","Loneliness adds beauty to life. It puts a special burn on sunsets and makes night air smell better. ","Man does not control his own fate. The women in his life do that for him. ","The only real failure in life is not to be true to the best one knows. ","One thing they never tell you about child raising is that for the rest of your life, at the drop of a hat, you are expected to know your childs name and how old he or she is. ","Without health life is not life; it is only a state of langour and suffering - an image of death. ","I believe that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone, best both for the body and the mind. ","Alcohol is the anesthesia by which we endure the operation of life. ","To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead. ","The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane. ","Life is not fair; get used to it. ","I havent trusted polls since I read that 62% of women had affairs during their lunch hour. Ive never met a woman in my life who would give up lunch for sex. ","The life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living. ","Probably the happiest period in life most frequently is in middle age, when the eager passions of youth are cooled, and the infirmities of age not yet begun; as we see that the shadows, which are at morning and evening so large, almost entirely disappear at midday. ","For me life is continuously being hungry. The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer. ","A man can live and be healthy without killing animals for food; therefore, if he eats meat, he participates in taking animal life merely for the sake of his appetite. ","A nation which has forgotten the quality of courage which in the past has been brought to public life is not as likely to insist upon or regard that quality in its chosen leaders today - and in fact we have forgotten. ","Each day is a little life: every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death. ","Maybe you dont like your job, maybe you didnt get enough sleep, well nobody likes their job, nobody got enough sleep. Maybe you just had the worst day of your life, but you know, theres no escape, theres no excuse, so just suck up and be nice. ","Acceptance of ones life has nothing to do with resignation; it does not mean running away from the struggle. On the contrary, it means accepting it as it comes, with all the handicaps of heredity, of suffering, of psychological complexes and injustices. ","If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast. ","All the breaks you need in life wait within your imagination, Imagination is the workshop of your mind, capable of turning mind energy into accomplishment and wealth. ","Accept responsibility for your life. Know that it is you who will get you where you want to go, no one else. ","The quality of a persons life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence, regardless of their chosen field of endeavor. ","To succeed in life, you need two things: ignorance and confidence. ","Say theres a white kid who lives in a nice home, goes to an all-white school, and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platter - for him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me, because what thats saying is that hes living a fantasy life of rebellion. ","Life is very interesting... in the end, some of your greatest pains, become your greatest strengths. ","I think computer viruses should count as life. I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. Weve created life in our own image. ","One of the secrets of life is that all that is really worth the doing is what we do for others. ","Be patient and understanding. Life is too short to be vengeful or malicious. ","The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom. ","Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life; everyone must carry out a concrete assignment that demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated, thus, everyones task is unique as his specific opportunity to implement it. ","False friendship, like the ivy, decays and ruins the walls it embraces; but true friendship gives new life and animation to the object it supports. ","The most glorious moments in your life are not the so-called days of success, but rather those days when out of dejection and despair you feel rise in you a challenge to life, and the promise of future accomplishments. ","Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life. ","Im not claiming divinity. Ive never claimed purity of soul. Ive never claimed to have the answers to life. I only put out songs and answer questions as honestly as I can... But I still believe in peace, love and understanding. ","Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing whats going to happen next. ","Develop an interest in life as you see it; the people, things, literature, music - the world is so rich, simply throbbing with rich treasures, beautiful souls and interesting people. Forget yourself. ","And by the way, everything in life is writable about if you have the outgoing guts to do it, and the imagination to improvise. The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt. ","Life is without meaning. You bring the meaning to it. The meaning of life is whatever you ascribe it to be. Being alive is the meaning. ","Babies dont need a vacation, but I still see them at the beach... it pisses me off! Ill go over to a little baby and say What are you doing here? You havent worked a day in your life! ","Opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging. ","The surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that it has never tried to contact us. ","I challenge you to make your life a masterpiece. I challenge you to join the ranks of those people who live what they teach, who walk their talk. ","The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure , the process is its own reward. ","Its better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life. ","Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. ","A return to first principles in a republic is sometimes caused by the simple virtues of one man. His good example has such an influence that the good men strive to imitate him, and the wicked are ashamed to lead a life so contrary to his example. ","All my life I have tried to pluck a thistle and plant a flower wherever the flower would grow in thought and mind. ","I blame my mother for my poor sex life. All she told me was the man goes on top and the woman underneath. For three years my husband and I slept in bunk beds. ","How do you go from where you are to where you wanna be? And I think you have to have an enthusiasm for life. You have to have a dream, a goal. And you have to be willing to work for it. ","You can never really live anyone elses life, not even your childs. The influence you exert is through your own life, and what youve become yourself. ","The ultimate value of life depends upon awareness and the power of contemplation rather than upon mere survival. ","The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, youve got it made. ","Creativity is a great motivator because it makes people interested in what they are doing. Creativity gives hope that there can be a worthwhile idea. Creativity gives the possibility of some sort of achievement to everyone. Creativity makes life more fun and more interesting. ","The joy of life consists in the exercise of ones energies, continual growth, constant change, the enjoyment of every new experience. To stop means simply to die. The eternal mistake of mankind is to set up an attainable ideal. ","For time and the world do not stand still. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future. ","There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening, that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all time, this expression is unique. ","I lost my sense of trust, honesty and compassion. I crashed down and became what I consider an emotional mess. Ive never been so miserable in my whole life. I just wanted to go to bed and never get up. ","The greatest thing in family life is to take a hint when a hint is intended-and not to take a hint when a hint isnt intended. ","Sometimes you trust someone who turns out not to be honest. There are a lot of things that happen in life that dont turn out the way youre given the impression that they will. And I think thats all kind of a con. But I think weve probably all been hurt. ","Friendship multiplies the good of life and divides the evil. ","We only live once, but once is enough if we do it right. Live your life with class, dignity, and style so that an exclamation, rather than a question mark signifies it! ","Life is as tedious as twice-told tale, vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man. ","But what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads? ","The way you think, the way you behave, the way you eat, can influence your life by 30 to 50 years. ","Where is the Life we have lost in living? Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information? ","Your life is the fruit of your own doing. You have no one to blame but yourself. ","For God so loved the World that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. ","A dream is your creative vision for your life in the future. You must break out of your current comfort zone and become comfortable with the unfamiliar and the unknown. ","I really havent had that exciting of a life. There are a lot of things I wish I would have done, instead of just sitting around and complaining about having a boring life. So I pretty much like to make it up. Id rather tell a story about somebody else. ","Truth is a deep kindness that teaches us to be content in our everyday life and share with the people the same happiness. ","Life is what we make it, always has been, always will be. ","Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly. ","If youre married, and you have a wife, and you really love your wife, is it good enough to only say to your wife I love her the day you get married? Or should you tell her every single day when you wake up and every opportunity? And thats how I feel about my relationship with Jesus Christ is that it is the most important thing in my life. ","Life is not what its supposed to be. Its what it is. The way you cope with it is what makes the difference. ","Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. ","People have a moral standard about what they will do and will not do. At the end of the day someone who cheats has a lower moral standard than someone who does not. And they will cheat in other areas of life as well. ","There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats. ","Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live. ","A chief event of life is the day in which we have encountered a mind that startled us. ","Ones life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, indignation and compassion. ","You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success - or are they holding you back? ","Blood relatives often have nothing to do with family, and similarly, family is about who you choose to make your life with. ","The value of life lies not in the length of days, but in the use we make of them... Whether you find satisfaction in life depends not on your tale of years, but on your will. ","If you like small government you need to work hard at having a strong national defense that is not so militant. Personal liberty is the purpose of government, to protect liberty - not to run your personal life, not to run the economy, and not to pretend that we can tell the world how they ought to live. ","What a wee little part of a persons life are his acts and his words! His real life is led in his head, and is known to none but himself. ","I just got one last thing, I urge all of you, all of you, to enjoy your life, the precious moments you have. To spend each day with some laughter and some thought, to get youre emotions going. ","Literature adds to reality, it does not simply describe it. It enriches the necessary competencies that daily life requires and provides; and in this respect, it irrigates the deserts that our lives have already become. ","The greatest humiliation in life, is to work hard on something from which you expect great appreciation, and then fail to get it. ","A well-developed sense of humor is the pole that adds balance to your steps as you walk the tightrope of life. ","Dreams are necessary to life. ","Life is the flower for which love is the honey. ","You cant make positive choices for the rest of your life without an environment that makes those choices easy, natural, and enjoyable. ","Never permit a dichotomy to rule your life, a dichotomy in which you hate what you do so you can have pleasure in your spare time. Look for a situation in which your work will give you as much happiness as your spare time. ","Life shrinks or expands in proportion to ones courage. ","Every man is the architect of his own life. He builds it just the way he wants it. However, after he has built what he wants, he sometimes decides that he doesnt like what he has built and looks for someone or something to blame instead of changing himself. ","Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the lepers bell of an approaching looter. ","It is better to create than to learn! Creating is the essence of life. ","Life is truly known only to those who suffer, lose, endure adversity and stumble from defeat to defeat. ","The care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only object of good government. ","Sorrow is knowledge, those that know the most must mourn the deepest, the tree of knowledge is not the tree of life. ","Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. ","Gratitude bestows reverence, allowing us to encounter everyday epiphanies, those transcendent moments of awe that change forever how we experience life and the world. ","Every day is a new opportunity. You can build on yesterdays success or put its failures behind and start over again. Thats the way life is, with a new game every day, and thats the way baseball is. ","Loneliness is my least favorite thing about life. The thing that Im most worried about is just being alone without anybody to care for or someone who will care for me. ","Freedom means you are unobstructed in living your life as you choose. Anything less is a form of slavery. ","A life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things. There will be sleeping enough in the grave. ","Difficult times have helped me to understand better than before, how infinitely rich and beautiful life is in every way, and that so many things that one goes worrying about are of no importance whatsoever. ","Life is essentially a cheat and its conditions are those of defeat; the redeeming things are not happiness and pleasure but the deeper satisfactions that come out of struggle. ","I have learned, that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. ","The moment we begin to fear the opinions of others and hesitate to tell the truth that is in us, and from motives of policy are silent when we should speak, the divine floods of light and life no longer flow into our souls. ","I dont get high, but sometimes I wish I did. That way, when I messed up in life I would have an excuse. But right now theres no rehab for stupidity. ","Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. ","When life knocks you down, try to land on your back. Because if you can look up, you can get up. Let your reason get you back up. ","Faith is a living, daring confidence in Gods grace, so sure and certain that a man could stake his life on it a thousand times. ","Dogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole. ","Our heavenly Father understands our disappointment, suffering, pain, fear, and doubt. He is always there to encourage our hearts and help us understand that Hes sufficient for all of our needs. When I accepted this as an absolute truth in my life, I found that my worrying stopped. ","Expect trouble as an inevitable part of life and repeat to yourself, the most comforting words of all; this, too, shall pass. ","I read and walked for miles at night along the beach, writing bad blank verse and searching endlessly for someone wonderful who would step out of the darkness and change my life. It never crossed my mind that that person could be me. ","Thank you, God, for this good life and forgive us if we do not love it enough. ","I have walked away from friendships when Ive realized that someone smiles to someones face and talks about them the minute they walk out of a room. I have no room in my life for that kind of negative energy anymore. ","There is only one success - to be able to spend your life in your own way. ","My definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel a ton of pleasure and very little pain - and because of your lifestyle, have the people around you feel a lot more pleasure than they do pain. ","Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life. ","Saving faith is an immediate relation to Christ, accepting, receiving, resting upon Him alone, for justification, sanctification, and eternal life by virtue of Gods grace. ","Im only going to stand before God and give an account for my life, not for somebody elses life. If I have a bad attitude, then I need to say theres no point in me blaming you for whats wrong in my life. ","The battle of life is, in most cases, fought uphill; and to win it without a struggle were perhaps to win it without honor. If there were no difficulties there would be no success; if there were nothing to struggle for, there would be nothing to be achieved. ","There is only one happiness in this life, to love and be loved. ","We have one life; it soon will be past; what we do for God is all that will last. ","When I chased after money, I never had enough. When I got my life on purpose and focused on giving of myself and everything that arrived into my life, then I was prosperous. ","I know that I will never find my father in any other man who comes into my life, because it is a void in my life that can only be filled by him. ","If you find someone you love in your life, then hang on to that love. ","I always like to look on the optimistic side of life, but I am realistic enough to know that life is a complex matter. ","Life is to be lived. If you have to support yourself, you had bloody well better find some way that is going to be interesting. And you dont do that by sitting around. ","For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a persons life at a given moment. ","Be thou the rainbow in the storms of life. The evening beam that smiles the clouds away, and tints tomorrow with prophetic ray. ","My life needs editing. ","What if you gave someone a gift, and they neglected to thank you for it - would you be likely to give them another? Life is the same way. In order to attract more of the blessings that life has to offer, you must truly appreciate what you already have. ","If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life. With confidence, you have won even before you have started. ","The highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about, nor read about, nor seen but, if one will, are to be lived. ","Life is not a spectator sport. If youre going to spend your whole life in the grandstand just watching what goes on, in my opinion youre wasting your life. ","When it comes to life the critical thing is whether you take things for granted or take them with gratitude. ","You have people come into your life shockingly and surprisingly. You have losses that you never thought youd experience. You have rejection and you have learn how to deal with that and how to get up the next day and go on with it. ","Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing. ","I pray God may preserve your health and life many years. ","They tell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice... that suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person. ","Being taken for granted can be a compliment. It means that youve become a comfortable, trusted element in another persons life. ","There was a time in my life when I thought I had everything - millions of dollars, mansions, cars, nice clothes, beautiful women, and every other materialistic thing you can imagine. Now I struggle for peace. ","Life began with waking up and loving my mothers face. ","Our life of poverty is as necessary as the work itself. Only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love God better because of them. ","He who binds to himself a joy Does the winged life destroy; But he who kisses the joy as it flies Lives in eternitys sun rise. ","It is a useless life that is not consecrated to a great ideal. It is like a stone wasted on the field without becoming a part of any edifice. ","I am just absolutely convinced that the best formula for giving us peace and preserving the American way of life is freedom, limited government, and minding our own business overseas. ","You know what your problem is, its that you havent seen enough movies - all of lifes riddles are answered in the movies. ","Keep your eyes open to your mercies. The man who forgets to be thankful has fallen asleep in life. ","We are the creative force of our life, and through our own decisions rather than our conditions, if we carefully learn to do certain things, we can accomplish those goals. ","Im not one of those complicated, mixed-up cats. Im not looking for the secret to life... I just go on from day to day, taking what comes. ","Never try to impress a woman, because if you do shell expect you to keep up the standard for the rest of your life. ","Tragedy in life normally comes with betrayal and compromise, and trading on your integrity and not having dignity in life. Thats really where failure comes. ","It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there lies your treasure. ","The life of an uneducated man is as useless as the tail of a dog which neither covers its rear end, nor protects it from the bites of insects. ","If youre bored with life - you dont get up every morning with a burning desire to do things - you dont have enough goals. ","People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. ","The key to success is to keep growing in all areas of life - mental, emotional, spiritual, as well as physical. ","About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some wont like you at all. ","Life can be pulled by goals just as surely as it can be pushed by drives. ","A life lived with integrity - even if it lacks the trappings of fame and fortune is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. ","There is more stupidity than hydrogen in the universe, and it has a longer shelf life. ","Develop interest in life as you see it; in people, things, literature, music - the world is so rich, simply throbbing with rich treasures, beautiful souls and interesting people. Forget yourself. ","Life is one grand, sweet song, so start the music. ","Too often in life, something happens and we blame other people for us not being happy or satisfied or fulfilled. So the point is, we all have choices, and we make the choice to accept people or situations or to not accept situations. ","Without deep reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people. ","It is not doing the thing we like to do, but liking the thing we have to do, that makes life blessed. ","The changes in our life must come from the impossibility to live otherwise than according to the demands of our conscience not from our mental resolution to try a new form of life. ","Let the refining and improving of your own life keep you so busy that you have little time to criticize others. ","A big part of financial freedom is having your heart and mind free from worry about the what-ifs of life. ","Time = Life, Therefore, waste your time and waste of your life, or master your time and master your life. ","We all pay for life with death, so everything in between should be free. ","Life could be wonderful if people would leave you alone. ","Never separate the life you live from the words you speak. ","In the last analysis, the individual person is responsible for living his own life and for finding himself. If he persists in shifting his responsibility to somebody else, he fails to find out the meaning of his own existence. ","The monotony and solitude of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind. ","The goal is to live a full, productive life even with all that ambiguity. No matter what happens, whether the cancer never flares up again or whether you die, the important thing is that the days that you have had you will have lived. ","I dont believe in an afterlife, so I dont have to spend my whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse. ","I havent understood a bar of music in my life, but I have felt it. "};
