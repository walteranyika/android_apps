    			String[] quote={"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. ","In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. ","Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. ","Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it. ","Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value. ","Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success. ","Think twice before you speak, because your words and influence will plant the seed of either success or failure in the mind of another. ","A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him. ","I dont know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody. ","I dont measure a mans success by how high he climbs but how high he bounces when he hits bottom. ","Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other. ","Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success. ","The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of will. ","Ive failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed. ","Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value. ","Dont aim for success if you want it; just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally. ","Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome. ","The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand. ","Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil. ","Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune. ","To succeed in life, you need two things: ignorance and confidence. ","If at first you dont succeed, try, try again. Then quit. Theres no point in being a damn fool about it. ","Develop success from failures. Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success. ","Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they cant lose. ","All you need is ignorance and confidence and the success is sure. ","It is no use saying, We are doing our best. You have got to succeed in doing what is necessary. ","Action is the foundational key to all success. ","I honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate. ","Success depends upon previous preparation, and without such preparation there is sure to be failure. ","A person with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds. ","No man succeeds without a good woman behind him. Wife or mother, if it is both, he is twice blessed indeed. ","Success is a science; if you have the conditions, you get the result. ","Defeat is not the worst of failures. Not to have tried is the true failure. ","Failure is success if we learn from it. ","The most important single ingredient in the formula of success is knowing how to get along with people. ","Success is not measured by what you accomplish, but by the opposition you have encountered, and the courage with which you have maintained the struggle against overwhelming odds. ","If you have no critics youll likely have no success. ","What is success? I think it is a mixture of having a flair for the thing that you are doing; knowing that it is not enough, that you have got to have hard work and a certain sense of purpose. ","Frustration, although quite painful at times, is a very positive and essential part of success. ","Whats money? A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do. ","Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get. ","Success or failure depends more upon attitude than upon capacity successful men act as though they have accomplished or are enjoying something. Soon it becomes a reality. Act, look, feel successful, conduct yourself accordingly, and you will be amazed at the positive results. ","Winning isnt everything, its the only thing. ","Success comes from knowing that you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming. ","If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself. ","One secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes. ","I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed. ","Man needs his difficulties because they are necessary to enjoy success. ","The ladder of success is best climbed by stepping on the rungs of opportunity. ","Once you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success, it enables you to ignore the minor hurts, the opponents pressure, and the temporary failures. ","Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. ","Dont confuse fame with success. Madonna is one; Helen Keller is the other. ","The successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way. ","As kids were not taught how to deal with success; were taught how to deal with failure. If at first you dont succeed, try, try again. If at first you succeed, then what? ","Failure is the key to success; each mistake teaches us something. ","Belief in oneself is one of the most important bricks in building any successful venture. ","Success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom. ","Pray that success will not come any faster than you are able to endure it. ","Eighty percent of success is showing up. ","Success is simple. Do whats right, the right way, at the right time. ","Whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times. ","Flaming enthusiasm, backed up by horse sense and persistence, is the quality that most frequently makes for success. ","He has achieved success who has worked well, laughed often, and loved much. ","The starting point of all achievement is desire. ","Prospering just doesnt have to do with money. ","In order to succeed you must fail, so that you know what not to do the next time. ","The greatest sign of success for a teacher... is to be able to say, The children are now working as if I did not exist. ","In this world it is not what we take up, but what we give up, that makes us rich. ","There is only one success - to be able to spend your life in your own way. ","Success isnt a result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire. ","Success is falling nine times and getting up ten. ","Most people give up just when theyre about to achieve success. They quit on the one yard line. They give up at the last minute of the game one foot from a winning touchdown. ","The thermometer of success is merely the jealousy of the malcontents. ","Diligence is the mother of good fortune. ","If you want to achieve things in life, youve just got to do them, and if youre talented and smart, youll succeed. ","Success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on after others have let go. ","If you wish to succeed in life, make perseverance your bosom friend, experience your wise counselor, caution your elder brother, and hope your guardian genius. ","I attribute my success to this - I never gave or took any excuse. ","There is little success where there is little laughter. ","They succeed, because they think they can. ","Success is dependent on effort. ","Failure is not an option. Everyone has to succeed. ","Success in almost any field depends more on energy and drive than it does on intelligence. This explains why we have so many stupid leaders. ","Success is the child of drudgery and perseverance. It cannot be coaxed or bribed; pay the price and it is yours. ","The common idea that success spoils people by making them vain, egotistic and self-complacent is erroneous; on the contrary it makes them, for the most part, humble, tolerant and kind. ","Success is not a good teacher, failure makes you humble. ","Success is blocked by concentrating on it and planning for it... Success is shy - it wont come out while youre watching. ","Its our nature: Human beings like success but they hate successful people. ","The measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with, but whether it is the same problem you had last year. ","Our worldly successes cannot be guaranteed, but our ability to achieve spiritual success is entirely up to us, thanks to the grace of God. The best advice I know is to give is to give those worldly things your best but never your all - reserve the ultimate hope for the only one who can grant it. ","Definiteness of purpose is the starting point of all achievement. ","I was obliged to be industrious. Whoever is equally industrious will succeed equally well. ","Success is counted sweetest by those who never succeed. ","Success is the one unpardonable sin against our fellows. ","The five essential entrepreneurial skills for success: Concentration, Discrimination, Organization, Innovation and Communication. ","Obedience is the mother of success and is wedded to safety. ","Success has a simple formula: do your best, and people may like it. ","Sometimes I worry about being a success in a mediocre world. ","Success consists of getting up just one more time than you fall. ","To be successful, you have to have your heart in your business and your business in your heart. ","Success is the progressive realization of predetermined, worthwhile, personal goals. ","Success is simply a matter of luck. Ask any failure. ","We fall forward to succeed. ","The man who has done his level best... is a success, even though the world may write him down a failure. ","After I won the Oscar, my salary doubled, my friends tripled, my children became more popular at school, my butcher made a pass at me, and my maid hit me up for a raise. ","Success is that old ABC - ability, breaks, and courage. ","Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal. My strength lies solely in my tenacity. ","The toughest thing about success is that youve got to keep on being a success. ","Nothing succeeds like success. ","To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded. ","Those who have succeeded at anything and dont mention luck are kidding themselves. ","Success is often the result of taking a misstep in the right direction. ","Nothing recedes like success. ","Success is like death. The more successful you become, the higher the houses in the hills get and the higher the fences get. ","Success breeds success. ","To be successful you have to be lucky, or a little mad, or very talented, or find yourself in a rapid growth field. ","Success to me is having ten honeydew melons and eating only the top half of each slice. ","How can they say my life is not a success? Have I not for more than sixty years got enough to eat and escaped being eaten? ","Success doesnt mean that you are healthy, success doesnt mean that youre happy, success doesnt mean that youre rested. Success really doesnt mean that you look good, or feel good, or are good. ","The secret of success is sincerity. ","Success isnt everything but it makes a man stand straight. ","In a balanced organization, working towards a common objective, there is success. ","The real secret of success is enthusiasm. ","The one phrase you can use is that success has a thousand fathers, and failure is an orphan. ","Its not enough that I should succeed - others should fail. ","Success is the space one occupies in the newspaper. Success is one days insolence. ","The success and the failure are not my concern, but His. ","Your success and happiness lies in you. Resolve to keep happy, and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties. ","Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved. ","Put your heart, mind, and soul into even your smallest acts. This is the secret of success. ","My mother was the most beautiful woman I ever saw. All I am I owe to my mother. I attribute all my success in life to the moral, intellectual and physical education I received from her. ","We should measure welfares success by how many people leave welfare, not by how many are added. ","Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty. ","There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure. ","The foundation stones for a balanced success are honesty, character, integrity, faith, love and loyalty. ","Money wont create success, the freedom to make it will. ","The size of your success is measured by the strength of your desire; the size of your dream; and how you handle disappointment along the way. ","That some achieve great success, is proof to all that others can achieve it as well. ","Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success. ","If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. ","The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. ","Israel was not created in order to disappear - Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom. ","Success makes so many people hate you. I wish it wasnt that way. It would be wonderful to enjoy success without seeing envy in the eyes of those around you. ","Its fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure. ","The secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you. If you do that, youre in control of your life. If you dont, life controls you. ","A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success. ","Part of the secret of a success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside. ","Many of lifes failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up. ","It has always seemed strange to me... the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest, are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second. ","If you want to succeed you should strike out on new paths, rather than travel the worn paths of accepted success. ","Like success, failure is many things to many people. With Positive Mental Attitude, failure is a learning experience, a rung on the ladder, a plateau at which to get your thoughts in order and prepare to try again. ","Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming. ","Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful. ","Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning. ","I believe that being successful means having a balance of success stories across the many areas of your life. You cant truly be considered successful in your business life if your home life is in shambles. ","A true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your success! ","Success is the result of perfection, hard work, learning from failure, loyalty, and persistence. ","Success is like reaching an important birthday and finding youre exactly the same. ","Before success comes in any mans life, hes sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps some failures. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit. Thats exactly what the majority of men do. ","The supreme quality for leadership is unquestionably integrity. Without it, no real success is possible, no matter whether it is on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office. ","Dictionary is the only place that success comes before work. Hard work is the price we must pay for success. I think you can accomplish anything if youre willing to pay the price. ","Before anything else, preparation is the key to success. ","Success does not consist in never making mistakes but in never making the same one a second time. ","The superior man makes the difficulty to be overcome his first interest; success only comes later. ","Never lose sight of the fact that the most important yardstick of your success will be how you treat other people - your family, friends, and coworkers, and even strangers you meet along the way. ","Money and success dont change people; they merely amplify what is already there. ","Success has always been a great liar. ","At the end of the day, the most overwhelming key to a childs success is the positive involvement of parents. ","Applause waits on success. ","The best revenge is massive success. ","We learned about honesty and integrity - that the truth matters... that you dont take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules... and success doesnt count unless you earn it fair and square. ","The test of success is not what you do when you are on top. Success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom. ","The first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself. ","Desire is the key to motivation, but its determination and commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of your goal - a commitment to excellence - that will enable you to attain the success you seek. ","The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they dont play together, the club wont be worth a dime. ","Success is never final, failure is never fatal. Its courage that counts. ","Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it. ","Success is steady progress toward ones personal goals. ","Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines, practiced every day. ","We must walk consciously only part way toward our goal, and then leap in the dark to our success. ","I have learned, that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. ","Any fact facing us is not as important as our attitude toward it, for that determines our success or failure. The way you think about a fact may defeat you before you ever do anything about it. You are overcome by the fact because you think you are. ","You cannot climb the ladder of success dressed in the costume of failure. ","Four things for success: work and pray, think and believe. ","Success is neither magical nor mysterious. Success is the natural consequence of consistently applying the basic fundamentals. ","The secret to success is to offend the greatest number of people. ","Honesty and integrity are absolutely essential for success in life - all areas of life. The really good news is that anyone can develop both honesty and integrity. ","Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure. ","Success comes from taking the initiative and following up... persisting... eloquently expressing the depth of your love. What simple action could you take today to produce a new momentum toward success in your life? ","Every day is a new opportunity. You can build on yesterdays success or put its failures behind and start over again. Thats the way life is, with a new game every day, and thats the way baseball is. ","That man is a success who has lived well, laughed often and loved much. ","The most glorious moments in your life are not the so-called days of success, but rather those days when out of dejection and despair you feel rise in you a challenge to life, and the promise of future accomplishments. ","Old age is like everything else. To make a success of it, youve got to start young. ","Success is doing ordinary things extraordinarily well. ","How many a man has thrown up his hands at a time when a little more effort, a little more patience would have achieved success. ","Success is not to be pursued; it is to be attracted by the person you become. ","If you wish to be a success in the world, promise everything, deliver nothing. ","Discipline is the soul of an army. It makes small numbers formidable; procures success to the weak, and esteem to all. ","In all our deeds, the proper value and respect for time determines success or failure. ","Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable. ","Success is dependent upon the glands - sweat glands. ","The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it: so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it. ","America is the most grandiose experiment the world has seen, but, I am afraid, it is not going to be a success. ","The battle of life is, in most cases, fought uphill; and to win it without a struggle were perhaps to win it without honor. If there were no difficulties there would be no success; if there were nothing to struggle for, there would be nothing to be achieved. ","Microsoft has had two goals in the last 10 years. One was to copy the Mac, and the other was to copy Lotus success in the spreadsheet - basically, the applications business. And over the course of the last 10 years, Microsoft accomplished both of those goals. And now they are completely lost. ","You do not pay the price of success, you enjoy the price of success. ","If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other persons point of view and see things from that persons angle as well as from your own. ","Success is the maximum utilization of the ability that you have. ","Success is often achieved by those who dont know that failure is inevitable. ","A graduation ceremony is an event where the commencement speaker tells thousands of students dressed in identical caps and gowns that individuality is the key to success. ","Success demands singleness of purpose. ","I couldnt wait for success, so I went ahead without it. ","I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. ","My definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel a ton of pleasure and very little pain - and because of your lifestyle, have the people around you feel a lot more pleasure than they do pain. ","There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. ","The key to success is to focus our conscious mind on things we desire not things we fear. ","Before everything else, getting ready is the secret of success. ","Success is getting what you want. Happiness is liking what you get. ","The making of friends who are real friends, is the best token we have of a mans success in life. ","You know you are on the road to success if you would do your job, and not be paid for it. ","Perseverance is a great element of success. If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake up somebody. ","One man cannot practice many arts with success. ","Anything that wont sell, I dont want to invent. Its sale is proof of utility, and utility is success. ","For unflagging interest and enjoyment, a household of children, if things go reasonably well, certainly all other forms of success and achievement lose their importance by comparison. ","What material success does is provide you with the ability to concentrate on other things that really matter. And that is being able to make a difference, not only in your own life, but in other peoples lives. ","Never continue in a job you dont enjoy. If youre happy in what youre doing, youll like yourself, youll have inner peace. And if you have that, along with physical health, you will have had more success than you could possibly have imagined. ","My success was not based so much on any great intelligence but on great common sense. ","The key to success is to keep growing in all areas of life - mental, emotional, spiritual, as well as physical. ","You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success - or are they holding you back? ","Our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan, in which we must fervently believe, and upon which we must vigorously act. There is no other route to success. ","Every success story has a parent who says, over my dead body. Every success story has an old person who walks up to you and says, when youre acting the fool, you know I worry about you sometimes. ","Were constantly striving for success, fame and comfort when all we really need to be happy is someone or some thing to be enthusiastic about. ","Obstacles are necessary for success because in selling, as in all careers of importance, victory comes only after many struggles and countless defeats. ","Successful people make money. Its not that people who make money become successful, but that successful people attract money. They bring success to what they do. ","The only thing Im addicted to is winning. This bootleg cult, arrogantly referred to as Alcoholics Anonymous, reports a 5 percent success rate. My success rate is 100 percent. ","I didnt know how to deal with success. If there was a Rock Star 101, I would have liked to take it. It might have helped me. ","If you have a success you have it for the wrong reasons. If you become popular it is always because of the worst aspects of your work. ","Success is almost totally dependent upon drive and persistence. The extra energy required to make another effort or try another approach is the secret of winning. ","If a man loves the labour of his trade, apart from any question of success or fame, the gods have called him. ","One important key to success is self-confidence. An important key to self-confidence is preparation. ","Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to cut all sources of retreat. Only by doing so can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to win - essential to success. ","I think you can have 10,000 explanations for failure, but no good explanation for success. ","A rejection is nothing more than a necessary step in the pursuit of success. ","The path to success is to take massive, determined action. ","Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall. ","Procrastination is one of the most common and deadliest of diseases and its toll on success and happiness is heavy. ","Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal, and just keep taking the next step towards completing it. If you arent sure which way to do something, do it both ways and see which works better. ","There is no force like success, and that is why the individual makes all effort to surround himself throughout life with the evidence of it; as of the individual, so should it be of the nation. ","I do not think that there is any other quality so essential to success of any kind as the quality of perseverance. It overcomes almost everything, even nature. ","I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything. ","I find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the work that precedes what the world calls success. ","Shes the kind of girl who climbed the ladder of success wrong by wrong. ","The ladder of success is never crowded at the top. ","No one who achieves success does so without acknowledging the help of others. The wise and confident acknowledge this help with gratitude. ","My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or blessed, believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. ","The two most important requirements for major success are: first, being in the right place at the right time, and second, doing something about it. ","You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself. ","Personality is the most important thing to an actresss success. ","Success in its highest and noblest form calls for peace of mind and enjoyment and happiness which come only to the man who has found the work that he likes best. ","Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note it... Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle. ","Sound character provides the power with which a person may ride the emergencies of life instead of being overwhelmed by them. Failure is... the highway to success. ","We learned about gratitude and humility - that so many people had a hand in our success, from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean... and we were taught to value everyones contribution and treat everyone with respect. ","No man ever achieved worth-while success who did not, at one time or other, find himself with at least one foot hanging well over the brink of failure. ","Those who cannot work with their hearts achieve but a hollow, half-hearted success that breeds bitterness all around. ","Ask yourself the secret of your success. Listen to your answer, and practice it. ","There is probably a perverse pride in my administration... that we were going to do the right thing, even if short-term it was unpopular. And I think anybody whos occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you cant be neglecting of marketing and P.R. and public opinion. ","One might think that the money value of an invention constitutes its reward to the man who loves his work. But... I continue to find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the work that precedes what the world calls success. ","Our limitations and success will be based, most often, on your own expectations for ourselves. What the mind dwells upon, the body acts upon. ","An artist cannot fail; it is a success to be one. ","God has already done everything Hes going to do. The ball is now in your court. If you want success, if you want wisdom, if you want to be prosperous and healthy, youre going to have to do more than meditate and believe; you must boldly declare words of faith and victory over yourself and your family.

Ten of those years were spent learning, four years were spent refining, and four years were spent in wild success. I was seeking comic originality, and fame fell on me as a byproduct.

If I felt it was the right thing to do, I was for it regardless of the possible outcome. ","Think of yourself as on the threshold of unparalleled success. A whole, clear, glorious life lies before you. Achieve! Achieve! ","Creative risk taking is essential to success in any goal where the stakes are high. Thoughtless risks are destructive, of course, but perhaps even more wasteful is thoughtless caution which prompts inaction and promotes failure to seize opportunity. ","Success is where preparation and opportunity meet. ","To have long term success as a coach or in any position of leadership, you have to be obsessed in some way. ","The more defects a man may have, the older he is, the less lovable, the more resounding his success. ","I think the first thing you should know is that nobody in country music made it the same way. Its all different. Theres no blueprint for success, and sometimes you just have to work at it.

Ive truly enjoyed my experience in NASCAR, to the point that I want to do it full time. ","When success comes, people can try to trick you or take advantage of you. ","No experience is a cause of success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences, so-called trauma - but we make out of them just what suits our purposes. ","The freedom to fail is vital if youre going to succeed. Most successful people fail from time to time, and it is a measure of their strength that failure merely propels them into some new attempt at success. ","Life affords no higher pleasure than that of surmounting difficulties, passing from one step of success to another, forming new wishes and seeing them gratified.

","Talent alone wont make you a success. Neither will being in the right place at the right time, unless you are ready. The most important question is: Are your ready?

","No student ever attains very eminent success by simply doing what is required of him: it is the amount and excellence of what is over and above the required, that determines the greatness of ultimate distinction. ","Education is a fundamental principle of what made America a success. We cant afford to throw any young people away. ","The only true measure of success is the ratio between what we might have done and what we might have been on the one hand, and the thing we have made and the things we have made of ourselves on the other. ","If you want to be truly successful invest in yourself to get the knowledge you need to find your unique factor. When you find it and focus on it and persevere your success will blossom.

","A desire to be in charge of our own lives, a need for control, is born in each of us. It is essential to our mental health, and our success, that we take control. ","The road to success is always under construction. ","A minutes success pays the failure of years. ","Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. ","Without an open-minded mind, you can never be a great success. ","Success has nothing to do with what you gain in life or accomplish for yourself. Its what you do for others. ","We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success. We often discover what will do, by finding out what will not do; and probably he who never made a mistake never made a discovery. ","Im hopeful. I know there is a lot of ambition in Washington, obviously. But I hope the ambitious realize that they are more likely to succeed with success as opposed to failure.

","My success and my misfortunes, the bright and the dark days I have gone through, everything has proved to me that in this world, either physical or moral, good comes out of evil just as well as evil comes out of good. ","Its very easy for me to say what success is. I think success is connecting with an audience who understands you and having a dialogue with them. I think success is continuing to push yourself forward creatively and not sort of becoming a caricature of yourself. ","The decadent international but individualistic capitalism in the hands of which we found ourselves after the war is not a success. It is not intelligent. It is not beautiful. It is not just. It is not virtuous. And it doesnt deliver the goods. ","People fall forward to success. ","I have always been pushed by the negative. The apparent failure of a play sends me back to my typewriter that very night, before the reviews are out. I am more compelled to get back to work than if I had a success. ","Luxury is the wolf at the door and its fangs are the vanities and conceits germinated by success. When an artist learns this, he knows where the danger is.

","The level of our success is limited only by our imagination and no act of kindness, however small, is ever wasted. ","The most successful men in the end are those whose success is the result of steady accretion. ","Be yourself. Follow your instincts. Success depends, at least in part, on the ability to carry it off. ","Enjoy your sweat because hard work doesnt guarantee success, but without it you dont have a chance. ","Like so many American families, our families werent asking for much. They didnt begrudge anyone elses success or care that others had much more than they did... in fact, they admired it. ","I am doomed to an eternity of compulsive work. No set goal achieved satisfies. Success only breeds a new goal. The golden apple devoured has seeds. It is endless. ","I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure - which is: Try to please everybody. ","The ladder of success in Hollywood is usually a press agent, actor, director, producer, leading man; and you are a star if you sleep with each of them in that order. Crude, but true. ","If success is a habit, it is a hard one to acquire. ","There could be no honor in a sure success, but much might be wrested from a sure defeat. ","Youve got to eat while you dream. Youve got to deliver on short-range commitments, while you develop a long-range strategy and vision and implement it. The success of doing both. Walking and chewing gum if you will.

And I want any force, any person, any element of an overarching Big Government that would stop your success, I want that organization, that element or that person to fail. I want you to succeed.

","Over the years, Ive become barraged by comments from people, such as, Beam me up, Scotty! and I became defensive. I felt they were derisive and engendered an attitude. I am grateful for the success, but didnt want to be mocked.

It doesnt make living easier. ","When youre around enormously successful people you realise their success isnt an accident - its about work. ","American inventiveness and the desire to build developed because we were guaranteed the right to own our success. ","We moved into the back, made it into a little 50s sitting room and started to sell the records. We had an immediate success. For one thing, these Teddy Boys were thrilled to buy the records. ","Ive had so much success. I had something to say, I got to say it, people heard it, and they agreed. Thats every artists dream. Thats the brass ring.

","The people who get more fame, who get more money, more often than not they are miserable, insecure and on anti-depressants.

","We are a people that have always celebrated other peoples success so long as we always had the opportunity to meet that success ourselves. That is the American nature. That is the American character. That is one of the things that makes us different from the rest of the world. And Im afraid we could lose that or are on the verge of losing that.

","I feel I am a role model to many, not just for my designs, but also for the fact that I started my own company with the help of my two friends. I became a success story, and people relate to that. ","We create success or failure on the course primarily by our thoughts. ","I passionately believe thats its not just what you say that counts, its also how you say it - that the success of your argument critically depends on your manner of presenting it. ","I think the idea that you know who your inner self is on a daily basis, because... you know. Whats good for you 25 years ago may not be good for you now. So, to keep in touch with that, I think thats the first ingredient for success. Because if youre a successful human being, everything else is gravy, I think.

","Your chances of success in any undertaking can always be measured by your belief in yourself. ","Humility is becoming a lost art, but its not difficult to practice. It means that you realize that others have been involved in your success. ","I suppose your security is your success and your key to success is your fine palate.

","Success is the person who year after year reaches the highest limits in his field. ","People are beginning to see that the first requisite to success in life is to be a good animal.

","You cannot allow your desire to be a winner to be diminished by achieving success before and I believe there is room for improvement in every sportsman. ","Remember, I come from such an excessively overdone, red-carpet place called Hollywood. So Im used to people blowing up their success in ways that are far above and beyond the truth. ","Youll never convince me there is a hopeless situation or there is any finality in any success or any failure. ","If I believe that I became the best quarterback that I could possibly be, the best football player that I could possibly be... Thats how Im going to measure my career as a success or not. ","I had been nine years in the theatre and hadnt had massive success. My only thing was I wanted to be an actor and I didnt care when, where, or how much for. ","When I look in the mirror, I see someone whos happy with how he looks, because I was never one of the handsome Hollywood people. And Ive had success as Ive gotten older, because Im able to play characters. I no longer get the girl, but I get the part. ","Success is always something completely different to people. I feel like Ive succeeded, if Im doing something that makes me happy and Im not lying to anybody. ","If being the biggest company was a guarantee of success, wed all be using IBM computers and driving GM cars. ","I planned my success. I knew it was going to happen. ","Fear can be good when youre walking past an alley at night or when you need to check the locks on your doors before you go to bed, but its not good when you have a goal and youre fearful of obstacles. We often get trapped by our fears, but anyone who has had success has failed before. ","In the end, you make your reputation and you have your success based upon credibility and being able to provide people who are really hungry for information what they want. ","I have never described the time I was in Doctor Who as anything except a kind of ecstatic success, but all the rest has been rather a muddle and a disappointment. Compared to Doctor Who, it has been an outrageous failure really - its so boring. ","Success always necessitates a degree of ruthlessness. Given the choice of friendship or success, Id probably choose success. ","One of the rewards of success is freedom, the ability to do whatever you like. ","Success in the majority of circumstances depends on knowing how long it takes to succeed. ","Theres not an instruction manual on how to deal with success, so you just have to rely on having great friends and a good team. ","Success in the United States is not an entitlement in China. You have to go there and earn it, and earn it the right way. ","Success is best when its shared. ","Successful entrepreneurs find the balance between listening to their inner voice and staying persistent in driving for success - because sometimes success is waiting right across from the transitional bump thats disguised as failure. ","Success is like a liberation or the first phrase of a love story. ","Faith has a role to play in life. It is not related to success. It is the other way round. Success is related to faith. Faith comes first. ","Success is related to faith. Faith comes first. ","The only success worth ones powder was success in the line of ones idiosyncrasy... what was talent but the art of being completely whatever one happened to be? ","Divorce is never a pleasant experience. You look upon it as a failure. But I learned to be a different person once we broke up. Sometimes you learn more from failure than you do from success. ","That should be the measure of success for everyone. Its not money, its not fame, its not celebrity; my index of success is happiness. ","Ive never been jealous of anybodys success. Ive been flummoxed by it because I dont understand it, but Im not jealous of it. ","But I like not these great success of yours; for I know how jealous are the gods.

In being candid, I have to own up to my own failures, both in my marriage and in my work environment. ","But I think its more normal for my team to have no success than it is to win two consecutive European cups. ","Im not a defender of old or new football managers. I believe in good ones and bad ones, those that achieve success and those that dont. ","Remember youre not entitled to anything. You have to earn your success every day, and you will make mistakes like everyone else. ","When I got my success, I became decadent for a while. This was 2003 to 2008. I fell for tiramisu really hard. Ive become more moderate since, because African-Americans are prone to diabetes.

","Fathers and mothers have lost the idea that the highest aspiration they might have for their children is for them to be wise... specialized competence and success are all that they can imagine. ","Success consists in being successful, not in having potential for success. Any wide piece of ground is the potential site of a palace, but theres no palace till its built. ","Married couples who work together to build and maintain a business assume broad responsibilities. Not only is their work important to our local and national economies, but their success is central to the well-being of their families. ","Theres nothing like success. ","If you come into success too soon, youll burn out and be finished before you know it. If you let the maturation process happen naturally, youll be happier with yourself in the end. ","Success is finding satisfaction in giving a little more than you take. ","The key to sitcom success is miserable people. If you see a happy couple, its just gone, like when Sam and Diane got together on Cheers. ","Theres a lot of blood, sweat, and guts between dreams and success. ","A friend at school was always being laughed at because his father emptied dustbins for a living. But those who laughed worshipped famous footballers. This is an example of our topsy-turvy view of success. Who would we miss most if they did not work for a month, the footballer or the garbage collector? ","Success is more dangerous than failure, the ripples break over a wider coastline. ","This weird thing happens when youre in a movie that has some level of success. People start offering you all kinds of things, and they just expect you to do them because theyll be good for your career. Its not about the projects integrity or anything like that. ","I dont believe in the so-called Latino explosion when it comes to movies. Jennifer Lopez doesnt have an accent. She grew up in New York speaking English, not Spanish.

I feel everything they feel, and therefore I think my readers care about them. ","Theres nothing so aphrodisiacal for a woman as money and success. ","Success will ruin your life. ","Many individuals are doing what they can. But real success can only come if there is a change in our societies and in our economics and in our politics.

","Ive had some success at writing and directing, and I like it. Its infinitely more creative than just acting, and I have things I want to say and do. ","I think the reason why a lot of young people are such screw ups... is oftentimes they didnt have the luxury I had of forming important relationships and opinions and life experiences before having success. ","The manic pursuit of success cost me everything I could love: my wife, my three children, some friends I would have liked to grow old with. ","The success of the Rat Pack or the Clan was due to the camaraderie, the three guys who work together and kid each other and love each other. ","The hardest thing to find in life is balance - especially the more success you have, the more you look to the other side of the gate. What do I need to stay grounded, in touch, in love, connected, emotionally balanced? Look within yourself. ","Although in skating you compete with other people, anyone who achieves a certain level of success is first and foremost competing against themselves. And for me the idea that I could always do better, learn more, learn faster, is something that came from skating. But I carried that with me for the rest of my life.

But Ive gained about twenty pounds over the past two years, and the more weight Ive put on, the more success Ive had. If you drew a diagram of weight gain and me getting more work, a mathematician would draw some conclusions from that. ","I think people often confuse success with fame and stardom. ","The real metric of success isnt the size of your bank account. Its the number of lives in whom you might be able to make a positive difference. ","It would be a joy for me if someone who was working with me became a big success. ","Sometimes people take it for granted that they had success, especially nowadays when you have instant stardom. A lot of people feel entitlement and nobody is entitled to anything. ","Success isnt about the end result, its about what you learn along the way. ","We just want to win. Thats the bottom line. I think a lot of times people may become content with one championship or a little bit of success, but we dont really reflect on what weve done in the past. We focus on the present. ","The only thing I can say about having this type of success is that you can get yourself in trouble because basically the world is set open for you. People will say yes to anything you ask, so its basically down to you and what you want or need. ","After Born to Run, I had a reaction to my good fortune. With success, it felt like a lot of people whod come before me lost some essential part of themselves. My greatest fear was that success was going to change or diminish that part of myself.

","Eventually, with success, I started to feel more and more isolated - like I didnt have a community of artists.

","For example, the equivalent of a woman being treated as a sex object is a man being treated as a success object. ","Im glad that my parents missed one thing that was really unbelievable. They saw me hit this great success. It was a blast and we had a lot of laughs. And it was just an amazing time. They passed away. And then after I got, you know, famous, all these haters came out of nowhere. ","My whole life, Ive wanted things before I was ready. I was always pushing for the next job, the next success. I was so focused on achieving and the path that I was missing some great point about life. ","Its only lonely at the top if you forget all the people you met along the way and fail to acknowledge their contributions to your success.

","Everyone has determination - its a question of how you use it. Hers is based on power and success and conquering; she doesnt care what she has to do or who gets hurt in the process.

","By far the most important factor in the success or failure of any school, far more important than tests or standards or business-model methods of accountability, is simply attracting the best-educated, most exciting young people into urban schools and keeping them there. ","Since the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland wants to remain a part of Great Britain, and since Ireland itself has shown little interest in reunification, the IRAs prospects for success through political channels have always been limited.

","Anybody who is an entrepreneur is a person who essentially has impaired judgment. The odds of success are zilch. ","Philanthropy is the thing that I am really excited about, and having success means I can do more. ","What works for men does not always work for women, because success and likability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. Thats what the research shows. As a man gets more successful, everyone is rooting for him. As a woman gets more successful, both men and women like her less. ","To me success means effectiveness in the world, that I am able to carry my ideas and values into the world - that I am able to change it in positive ways.

","Indeed I regard the enduring support which I have received over the years from all sections of the community in Ballymena as being more than sufficient recognition for any success which I may have achieved as an actor. ","Today, people idolize athletes and celebrities - and yes, highly successful and visionary business people like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, but not the innovators who perhaps have not seen such high-flying levels of success. Can anyone name the inventors of GPS, which has such a huge impact on our lives today? ","The NFL has been an amazing page in this chapter of my life. I pray that all successive adventures offer me the same potential for growth, success and most importantly fun. ","Success is attaining your dream while helping others to benefit from that dream materializing.

","I worked half my life to be an overnight success, and still it took me by surprise. ","The historical basis for the gap between the black middle class and underclass shows that ending discrimination, by itself, would not eradicate black poverty and dysfunction. We also need intervention to promulgate a middle-class ethic of success among the poor, while expanding opportunities for economic betterment. ","Once you can accept failure, you can have fun and success. ","It takes two to make a marriage a success and only one to make it a failure. ","I never place limits on the potential success of my students. If theyre going into acting, theyre going to win the Oscar... If theyre going into law, theyre going to be chief justice. ","I dont think success has changed us as people at all. We are the same lunatics that we were when this band first got going. We never see ourselves as being on a higher level than our fans. ","Im happy for the success that Ive had, but Ive worked so hard at it. ","Ever since Ive been blessed with success, Ive struggled a little with anonymity and even family. Ive had people calling asking for money, and I have to ask them first, Are you working? Have you been trying to help yourself? Then I feel like I can help. ","Be careful of success; it has a dark side. ","Success is what you do with your ability. Its how you use your talent. ","Your chances of success are directly proportional to the degree of pleasure you desire from what you do. If you are in a job you hate, face the fact squarely and get out. ","Whatever success Ive had, I always like to top it. ","In New York, everyones desperate for success, desperate for money and desperate to be accepted, but in London theyre more laid back about things like that. ","As my father used to tell me, the only true sign of success in life is being able to do for a living that which makes you happy. ","I see nothing wrong with the human trait to desire. In fact, I consider it integral to our success mechanism. Becoming attached to what we desire is what causes the trouble. If you must have it in order to be happy, then you are denying the happiness of the here and now. ","Real success is not on the stage, but off the stage as a human being, and how you get along with your fellow man. ","Success will always be measured by the extent to which we serve the buying public. ","Follow your passion. Nothing - not wealth, success, accolades or fame - is worth spending a lifetime doing things you dont enjoy. ","If Id had a great level of success early on, who knows how I would have responded. I might have been a complete jerk. ","Ive thought a lot about success, because its very strange to me that Ive been successful. ","The proud depend upon the world to tell them whether they have value or not. Their self-esteem is determined by where they are judged to be on the ladders of worldly success. They feel worthwhile as individuals if the numbers beneath them in achievement, talent, beauty, or intellect are large enough. ","Without Arthurs voice, I never would have enjoyed that success. ","The secret to success is to own nothing, but control everything. ","The traditional American family has always been the foundation for success in America. ","In my time and neighborhood (and in my soul) there was only one standard by which a woman measured success: did some man want her? ","It doesnt matter whether you are pursuing success in business, sports, the arts, or life in general: The bridge between wishing and accomplishing is discipline. ","I dont think about financial success as the measurement of my success. ","I never expected any sort of success with Mockingbird... I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. ","Fame is something that is bestowed upon you because of success. Success is something you have to chase. ","Success is the sum of details. ","The quick success was a bit strange to get used to. ","It was a way out of poverty. It was a way to success. It was a way to education. And it was a way to a brighter day for me. ","I dont attribute an actors great success to their own individual performance when its something as collaborative as a movie. ","Everyone talks about how they knew the Bond films were going to be a success, but it simply isnt true. ","Success and the art of making music are two different things for me. ","Hip-hop is more about attaining wealth. People respect success. They respect big. They dont even have to like your music. If youre big enough, people are drawn to you. ","I think that my biggest attribute to any success that I have had is hard work. There really is no substitute for working hard. ","The great dream merchant Disney was a success because make-believe was what everyone seemed to need in a spiritually empty land. ","Success turns a lot of people off. I have a pretty solid sense of joy and respect that irritates people, and can irritate me, too. ","There are so few women in general who arent completely threatened and confused by other womens success. Its very disappointing. ","While I was making my solo films, RKO was busily trying to get me and Fred Astaire back together. The studio wanted to capitalize on the success of Flying Down to Rio and realized that the pairing of Rogers and Astaire had moneymaking potential. ","Im extremely ambitious. I dont know why people are afraid to say that. I wont sell my soul to the devil, but I do want success and I dont think thats bad. ","There is no scientific answer for success. You cant define it. Youve simply got to live it and do it. ","I dont want to wake up and be bored. Thats probably my greatest fear is to have nothing to do. What better job is there than to play quarterback for an NFL team, and certainly one that Ive been on for a long time and had success with? I dont plan on giving it up any time soon. ","The first myth of management is that it exists. The second myth of management is that success equals skill. ","And in reality, I dont think its a real documentary. Its more a story of her life. Its a story of survival. Its a story of the time in which she lived. The story of success and failure. ","Success depends almost entirely on how effectively you learn to manage the games two ultimate adversaries: the course and yourself. ","With the success of a show, you get an opportunity to call attention to things that you believe in. ","Success, for me, is a song that can deliver shivers. ","When I first started doing sketch comedy, I promised myself that if I were ever to have any success in this business, I wouldnt hold back. Why get there and play it safe? ","Success produces confidence; confidence relaxes industry, and negligence ruins the reputation which accuracy had raised. ","Im different, and I have to be a warrior to be that way. But I have had some success; I hope I have touched the lives of some wonderful people, all by being what I see as myself but some others people see as different. ","Success is always something completely different to people. I feel like Ive succeeded, if Im doing something that makes me happy and Im not lying to anybody. Im not doing that now, so I feel really good about myself. ","Enjoy failure and learn from it. You can never learn from success. ","In the digital age of overnight success stories such as Facebook, the hard slog is easily overlooked. ","The delusions of self-love cannot be prevented, but intellectual misconceptions as to the means of achieving success may be corrected. ","There is a deep sadness to American poverty, greater than the sadness of any other kind. Its because America has such an ideology of success. ","Though I was excited about the Sojourner Truth play, it was not reassuring to think that my entire future might depend on the success of that one show. ","It was very clear to me in 1965, in Mississippi, that, as a lawyer, I could get people into schools, desegregate the schools, but if they were kicked off the plantations - and if they didnt have food, didnt have jobs, didnt have health care, didnt have the means to exercise those civil rights, we were not going to have success. ","The optimist underestimates how difficult it is to achieve real change, believing that anything is possible and its possible now. Only by confronting head-on the reality that all progress is going to be obstructed by vested interests and corrupted by human venality can we create realistic programmes that actually have a chance of success. ","Id rather invest in an entrepreneur who has failed before than one who assumes success from day one. ","The success of any great moral enterprise does not depend upon numbers. ","I realise that I do not change the course of history. I am an actor, I do a movie, thats the end of it. You have to realise we are just clowns for hire. After I had success it was great, at first, not to worry about money. It was on my mind when I was growing up. ","I want to make sure I dont interfere with the success of that team next year. I dont see any way I could go to practice like most of em do, and not hurt the team. Id go nuts if I tried doing that. ","Success in management requires learning as fast as the world is changing. ","Modesty should be typical of the success of a champion. ","The truth is, what Americans enjoy about football is much of what makes the sport dangerous. However, I believe there must be a way to find the art of success and vitality in football, without the driving the level of impact that causes serious risk of head trauma, paralysis and other life-changing injuries. ","Apple Computer would not have reached its current peak of success if it had feared to roll the dice and launch products that didnt always hit the mark. In the mid-1990s, the company was considered washed up, Steve Jobs had departed, and a string of lackluster product launches unrelated to the companys core business. ","Success is the necessary misfortune of life, but it is only to the very unfortunate that it comes early. ","Every movie that Ive had to really knock down the door for has been an enormous success for me. Not just like a financial success but a real personal success. ","Success makes you less intimidated by things. ","I dont dwell on success. Maybe thats one reason Im successful. ","Although in skating you compete with other people, anyone who achieves a certain level of success is first and foremost competing against themselves. And for me, the idea that I could always do better, learn more, learn faster, is something that came from skating. ","I rejected the notion that my race or sex would bar my success in life. ","Well, certainly one of the ironies of the success of affirmative action is that the middle class within the black community no longer lives within black community by and large. ","We dissect failure a lot more than we dissect success. ","Like everybody, I have invested in things that have gone bad, because theres never any guarantee of success or profit when it comes to money. ","An investment said to have an 80% chance of success sounds far more attractive than one with a 20% chance of failure. The mind cant easily recognize that they are the same. ","The most absurd and reckless aspirations have sometimes led to extraordinary success. ","The success that the Tolkien books had redefined modern fantasy. ","Success is very ephemeral. You depend entirely on the desire of others, which makes it difficult to relax. ","Yes I have made a lot of money and I have a lot of respect, my films have done well, and I know there are loads of loads of people who look up to me and really love me. I really just thought this is like a strange dream. I have never thought this is a success - I dont have a standard. ","I like people who are able to keep pushing themselves and challenging themselves even after great success. ","I wont sell my soul to the devil, but I do want success and I dont think thats bad. ","Im not even aware of my success. Success is such an illusion. ","Such a faith would be fatal to my reason, to my liberty, and even to the success of my undertakings; it would immediately transform me into a stupid slave, an instrument of the will and interests of others. ","I get hired by companies to hack into their systems and break into their physical facilities to find security holes. Our success rate is 100%; weve always found a hole. ","My history in show business spans over a quarter of a century, and I have seen many people in the industry struggle with coming out, only to find much more success after they finally did. ","Its the quality of the ordinary, the straight, the square, that accounts for the great stability and success of our nation. Its a quality to be proud of. But its a quality that many people seem to have neglected. ","When you grow up in the music industry, trying to be Britney Spears because thats what sells records and then you realize, All I have to do is be myself? I should have thought of that a long time ago, it feels good to have success come from whats actually inside of you. ","To me, the success of the cyberactivists in Tunisia is actually very interesting, because many of them explicitly rejected any support from Washington. ","Evolution acts slowly. Our psychological characteristics today are those that promoted reproductive success in the ancestral environmen. ","I think that success is having fun. ","There is no middle ground in Hollywood; youre a failure or youre a success. That mentality is wild. ","I believe success is preparation, because opportunity is going to knock on your door sooner or later but are you prepared to answer that? ","Success is more difficult to handle than failure. ","Ive known entrepreneurs who were not great salespeople, or didnt know how to code, or were not particularly charismatic leaders. But I dont know of any entrepreneurs who have achieved any level of success without persistence and determination. ","True leadership lies in guiding others to success. In ensuring that everyone is performing at their best, doing the work they are pledged to do and doing it well. ","The true measure of your worth includes all the benefits others have gained from your success. ","We do not celebrate people who have made success out of serious hard work. ","Thought is the original source of all wealth, all success, all material gain, all great discoveries and inventions, and of all achievement. ","I am excited to share my archive pictures and footage. Ill also share announcements about current events and success stories from the Sugar Ray Leonard Foundation to help fight diabetes and child obesity. ","When people stand up and talk about the great success that the EU has been, Im not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore. ","I love performing, but I never really liked show business. My success is my family. I want to be more successful as a mother. ","Im not looking for career attention, for more success, more money. Im just singing songs I chose because I love them. ","The hardest thing to find in life is balance - especially, the more success you have, the more you look to the other side of the gate. ","Im passionate about my fans and my shows. But my biggest reward in the success that is my life are my husband and kids. ","Independent films have a very different cachet than success films. ","The framers of the Constitution were so clear in the federalist papers and elsewhere that they felt an independent judiciary was critical to the success of the nation. ","I always envisioned myself being a rapper and being in the game and having success, but you never know what it feels like or how youre going to be when youre there. ","Yeah, ideally, Id probably wish to be more anonymous. But scrutiny and success go together. And I want to be successful. ","When I became successful, I put up a caution. I didnt think it was fair to have the shadow of that kind of success thrown on my family. And I was cautious about being taken by things that could destroy you. ","The Simpsons obviously is a huge success, and Fox has nothing to do with its success, with its creative success, and as a result they dont really like the show. They dont like The Simpsons at Fox. ","Happy people are ignoramuses and glory is nothing else but success, and to achieve it one only has to be cunning. ","Well, I believe that the depth of your struggle can determine the height of your success. I was inspired to come out of everything Ive been through and end up in a place where I never thought that I would be. ","Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of the air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success. ","Its both rebellion and conformity that attack you with success. ","Elegance is not a dispensable luxury but a factor that decides between success and failure. ","Were born with success. It is only others who point out our failures, and what they attribute to us as failure. ","I want to see success right away. And I want to never give up, never stop. ","Once you achieve a certain level of success or fame, it becomes really difficult to go against type. ","When I was a kid, I had ambitions for being a television announcer, which was before television took off, you know, in the late 40s. And just through necessity, going out looking for work, I was starting to sing, and dance, and act, and I never expected to do that, nor to have any success at it at least. ","There is no correlation between a childhood success and a professional athlete. ","What is success? It is a toy balloon among children armed with pins. "};
