","I know that I will never find my father in any other man who comes into my life, because it is a void in my life that can only be filled by him. ","If you find someone you love in your life, then hang on to that love. ","I always like to look on the optimistic side of life, but I am realistic enough to know that life is a complex matter. ","Life is to be lived. If you have to support yourself, you had bloody well better find some way that is going to be interesting. And you dont do that by sitting around. ","For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a persons life at a given moment. ","Be thou the rainbow in the storms of life. The evening beam that smiles the clouds away, and tints tomorrow with prophetic ray. ","My life needs editing. ","What if you gave someone a gift, and they neglected to thank you for it - would you be likely to give them another? Life is the same way. In order to attract more of the blessings that life has to offer, you must truly appreciate what you already have. ","If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life. With confidence, you have won even before you have started. ","The highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about, nor read about, nor seen but, if one will, are to be lived. ","Life is not a spectator sport. If youre going to spend your whole life in the grandstand just watching what goes on, in my opinion youre wasting your life. ","When it comes to life the critical thing is whether you take things for granted or take them with gratitude. ","You have people come into your life shockingly and surprisingly. You have losses that you never thought youd experience. You have rejection and you have learn how to deal with that and how to get up the next day and go on with it. ","Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing. ","I pray God may preserve your health and life many years. ","They tell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice... that suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person. ","Being taken for granted can be a compliment. It means that youve become a comfortable, trusted element in another persons life. ","There was a time in my life when I thought I had everything - millions of dollars, mansions, cars, nice clothes, beautiful women, and every other materialistic thing you can imagine. Now I struggle for peace. ","Life began with waking up and loving my mothers face. ","Our life of poverty is as necessary as the work itself. Only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love God better because of them. ","He who binds to himself a joy Does the winged life destroy; But he who kisses the joy as it flies Lives in eternitys sun rise. ","It is a useless life that is not consecrated to a great ideal. It is like a stone wasted on the field without becoming a part of any edifice. ","I am just absolutely convinced that the best formula for giving us peace and preserving the American way of life is freedom, limited government, and minding our own business overseas. ","You know what your problem is, its that you havent seen enough movies - all of lifes riddles are answered in the movies. ","Keep your eyes open to your mercies. The man who forgets to be thankful has fallen asleep in life. ","We are the creative force of our life, and through our own decisions rather than our conditions, if we carefully learn to do certain things, we can accomplish those goals. ","Im not one of those complicated, mixed-up cats. Im not looking for the secret to life... I just go on from day to day, taking what comes. ","Never try to impress a woman, because if you do shell expect you to keep up the standard for the rest of your life. ","Tragedy in life normally comes with betrayal and compromise, and trading on your integrity and not having dignity in life. Thats really where failure comes. ","It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there lies your treasure. ","The life of an uneducated man is as useless as the tail of a dog which neither covers its rear end, nor protects it from the bites of insects. ","If youre bored with life - you dont get up every morning with a burning desire to do things - you dont have enough goals. ","People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. ","The key to success is to keep growing in all areas of life - mental, emotional, spiritual, as well as physical. ","About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some wont like you at all. ","Life can be pulled by goals just as surely as it can be pushed by drives. ","A life lived with integrity - even if it lacks the trappings of fame and fortune is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come. ","There is more stupidity than hydrogen in the universe, and it has a longer shelf life. ","Develop interest in life as you see it; in people, things, literature, music - the world is so rich, simply throbbing with rich treasures, beautiful souls and interesting people. Forget yourself. ","Life is one grand, sweet song, so start the music. ","Too often in life, something happens and we blame other people for us not being happy or satisfied or fulfilled. So the point is, we all have choices, and we make the choice to accept people or situations or to not accept situations. ","Without deep reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people. ","It is not doing the thing we like to do, but liking the thing we have to do, that makes life blessed. ","The changes in our life must come from the impossibility to live otherwise than according to the demands of our conscience not from our mental resolution to try a new form of life. ","Let the refining and improving of your own life keep you so busy that you have little time to criticize others. ","A big part of financial freedom is having your heart and mind free from worry about the what-ifs of life. ","Time = Life, Therefore, waste your time and waste of your life, or master your time and master your life. ","We all pay for life with death, so everything in between should be free. ","Life could be wonderful if people would leave you alone. ","Never separate the life you live from the words you speak. ","In the last analysis, the individual person is responsible for living his own life and for finding himself. If he persists in shifting his responsibility to somebody else, he fails to find out the meaning of his own existence. ","The monotony and solitude of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind. ","The goal is to live a full, productive life even with all that ambiguity. No matter what happens, whether the cancer never flares up again or whether you die, the important thing is that the days that you have had you will have lived. ","I dont believe in an afterlife, so I dont have to spend my whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse. ","I havent understood a bar of music in my life, but I have felt it. ","Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and youre kind, amazing things will happen. ","Once I knew only darkness and stillness... my life was without past or future... but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness, and my heart leaped to the rapture of living. ","Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work. ","Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life. ","Do not be too moral. You may cheat yourself out of much life so. Aim above morality. Be not simply good; be good for something. ","People are taken aback by a confident, pretty girl who knows what she wants in life and isnt going to let anyone get in her way. And you know what its all about? Jealousy. ","There is no force like success, and that is why the individual makes all effort to surround himself throughout life with the evidence of it; as of the individual, so should it be of the nation. ","Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience lifes deepest joy: true fulfillment. ","Music is love, love is music, music is life, and I love my life. Thank you and good night. ","I would like to be remembered as a man who had a wonderful time living life, a man who had good friends, fine family - and I dont think I could ask for anything more than that, actually. ","I would say my greatest achievement in life right now - my greatest achievement period is - and Im still trying to achieve it - is to be a wonderful father to my kids. ","One must be fond of people and trust them if one is not to make a mess of life. ","Life begins at the end of your comfort zone. ","We are all sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skins, for life. ","Im at the age where food has taken the place of sex in my life. In fact, Ive just had a mirror put over my kitchen table. ","Once youve wrestled, everything else in life is easy. ","The only way to enjoy anything in this life is to earn it first. ","One of the sanest, surest, and most generous joys of life comes from being happy over the good fortune of others. ","The good life is a process, not a state of being. It is a direction not a destination. ","Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death. If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present. ","You cannot find peace by avoiding life. ","My rule of life prescribed as an absolutely sacred rite smoking cigars and also the drinking of alcohol before, after and if need be during all meals and in the intervals between them. ","In poverty and other misfortunes of life, true friends are a sure refuge. The young they keep out of mischief; to the old they are a comfort and aid in their weakness, and those in the prime of life they incite to noble deeds. ","And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values, like you work hard for what you want in life. That your word is your bond; that you do what you say youre going to do. That you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them. ","I never did a days work in my life. It was all fun. ","Each moment of a happy lovers hour is worth an age of dull and common life. ","If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life. ","Let everyone try and find that as a result of daily prayer he adds something new to his life, something with which nothing can be compared. ","Life is a sexually transmitted disease and the mortality rate is one hundred percent. ","If you want to achieve things in life, youve just got to do them, and if youre talented and smart, youll succeed. ","Life would be tragic if it werent funny. ","Television is not real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs. ","Using the power of decision gives you the capacity to get past any excuse to change any and every part of your life in an instant. ","My philosophy of life is that if we make up our mind what we are going to make of our lives, then work hard toward that goal, we never lose - somehow we win out. ","The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. ","My advice to people today is as follows: if you take the game of life seriously, if you take your nervous system seriously, if you take your sense organs seriously, if you take the energy process seriously, you must turn on, tune in, and drop out. ","Build a man a fire, and hell be warm for a day. Set a man on fire, and hell be warm for the rest of his life. ","If I had to live my life again, Id make the same mistakes, only sooner. ","I need drama in my life to keep making music. ","Lifes like a movie, write your own ending. Keep believing, keep pretending. ","Becoming a father, I think it inevitably changes your perspective of life. I dont get nearly enough sleep. And the simplest things in life are completely satisfying. I find you dont have to do as much, like you dont go on as many outings. ","The purpose of human life is to serve, and to show compassion and the will to help others. ","If your daily life seems poor, do not blame it; blame yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches; for the Creator, there is no poverty. ","The unexamined life is not worth living. ","God is to be worshipped as the one beloved, dearer than everything in this and next life. ","Constant development is the law of life, and a man who always tries to maintain his dogmas in order to appear consistent drives himself into a false position. ","Theres only two people in your life you should lie to... the police and your girlfriend. ","Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Dont lose faith. ","Today is life-the only life you are sure of. Make the most of today. Get interested in something. Shake yourself awake. Develop a hobby. Let the winds of enthusiasm sweep through you. Live today with gusto. ","I am an example of what is possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by people around them. I was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life who taught me about quiet strength and dignity. ","Do every act of your life as if it were your last. ","Apply yourself both now and in the next life. Without effort, you cannot be prosperous. Though the land be good, You cannot have an abundant crop without cultivation. ","The resistance that you fight physically in the gym and the resistance that you fight in life can only build a strong character. ","It is one of the beautiful compensations in this life that no one can sincerely try to help another without helping himself. ","Life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind. ","If I had to choose a religion, the sun as the universal giver of life would be my god. ","When you do the common things in life in an uncommon way, you will command the attention of the world. ","For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one. ","Im not an example for how people should live their lives. Never in my life would I ever set out to be an example for people on how to live their lives. If you need an example for how to live, then you just shouldnt have been born. Straight up. ","Mans real life is happy, chiefly because he is ever expecting that it soon will be so. ","Sleep - the most beautiful experience in life - except drink. ","Your belief in God is merely an escape from your monotonous, stupid and cruel life. ","Ive reached a point in my life where its the little things that matter... I was always a rebel and probably could have got much farther had I changed my attitude. But when you think about it, I got pretty far without changing attitudes. Im happier with that. ","Life is full of misery, loneliness, and suffering - and its all over much too soon. ","Dreams do come true, if we only wish hard enough, You can have anything in life if you will sacrifice everything else for it. ","Life is not an easy matter... You cannot live through it without falling into frustration and cynicism unless you have before you a great idea which raises you above personal misery, above weakness, above all kinds of perfidy and baseness. ","The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time. ","The struggle of my life created empathy - I could relate to pain, being abandoned, having people not love me. ","Whatever you do in life, surround yourself with smart people wholl argue with you. ","Let love flow so that it cleanses the world. Then man can live in peace, instead of the state of turmoil he has created through his past ways of life, with all those material interests and earthly ambitions. ","Life is never fair, and perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not. ","Your daily life is your temple and your religion. When you enter into it take with you your all. ","Every year of my life I grow more convinced that it is wisest and best to fix our attention on the beautiful and the good, and dwell as little as possible on the evil and the false. ","The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence. ","Thug Life to me is dead. ","Every human is an artist. The dream of your life is to make beautiful art. ","I dont have expectations. Expectations in your life just lead to giant disappointments. ","The real test of friendship is: can you literally do nothing with the other person? Can you enjoy those moments of life that are utterly simple? ","You come to a point in your life when you really dont care what people think about you, you just care what you think about yourself. ","All brave men love; for he only is brave who has affections to fight for, whether in the daily battle of life, or in physical contests. ","Life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves. ","A man who has been the indisputable favorite of his mother keeps for life the feeling of a conqueror. ","As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death. ","School is practice for future life, practice makes perfect and nobodys perfect, so why practice? ","I havent lived a perfect life. I have regrets. But thats from a lifetime of taking chances, making decisions, and trying not to be frozen. The only thing that I can do with my regrets is understand them. ","I wish that every human life might be pure transparent freedom. ","My trust in a higher power that wants me to survive and have love in my life, is what keeps me moving forward. ","Love is the greatest refreshment in life. ","Let us put our minds together and see what life we can make for our children. ","Communication is a skill that you can learn. Its like riding a bicycle or typing. If youre willing to work at it, you can rapidly improve the quality of evry part of your life. ","I actually thought that it would be a little confusing during the same period of your life to be in one meeting when youre trying to make money, and then go to another meeting where youre giving it away. I mean is it gonna erode your ability, you know, to make money? Are you gonna somehow get confused about what youre trying to do? ","The life of the nation is secure only while the nation is honest, truthful, and virtuous. ","There is a fountain of youth: it is your mind, your talents, the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of people you love. When you learn to tap this source, you will truly have defeated age. ","Thats the way I got along in life. I dont ever remember being particularly jealous of anybody, because I figured if I cant do it myself, I dont deserve to get it. ","It is a bit embarrassing to have been concerned with the human problem all ones life and find at the end that one has no more to offer by way of advice than try to be a little kinder. ","I decided to devote my life to telling the story because I felt that having survived I owe something to the dead. and anyone who does not remember betrays them again. ","Man is subject to innumerable pains and sorrows by the very condition of humanity, and yet, as if nature had not sown evils enough in life, we are continually adding grief to grief and aggravating the common calamity by our cruel treatment of one another. ","When we long for life without difficulties, remind us that oaks grow strong in contrary winds and diamonds are made under pressure. ","We have to be able to grow up. Our wrinkles are our medals of the passage of life. They are what we have been through and who we want to be. ","My Alma mater was books, a good library... I could spend the rest of my life reading, just satisfying my curiosity. ","My mother wanted us to understand that the tragedies of your life one day have the potential to be comic stories the next. ","You leave old habits behind by starting out with the thought, I release the need for this in my life. ","We have the duty to protect the life of an unborn child. ","Imagination and fiction make up more than three quarters of our real life. ","Life is ten percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you respond to it. ","No one is in control of your happiness but you; therefore, you have the power to change anything about yourself or your life that you want to change. ","Whatever I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my heart to do it well; whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself completely; in great aims and in small I have always thoroughly been in earnest. ","Life is either a great adventure or nothing. ","No evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death. ","There are moments in life, when the heart is so full of emotion That if by chance it be shaken, or into its depths like a pebble Drops some careless word, it overflows, and its secret, Spilt on the ground like water, can never be gathered together. ","I have so much chaos in my life, its become normal. You become used to it. You have to just relax, calm down, take a deep breath and try to see how you can make things work rather than complain about how theyre wrong. ","Ones family is the most important thing in life. I look at it this way: One of these days Ill be over in a hospital somewhere with four walls around me. And the only people wholl be with me will be my family. ","A hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself. ","I like people that enjoy life, cause I do the same. ","The wise man does not expose himself needlessly to danger, since there are few things for which he cares sufficiently; but he is willing, in great crises, to give even his life - knowing that under certain conditions it is not worthwhile to live. ","Bottom line is, I didnt return to Apple to make a fortune. Ive been very lucky in my life and already have one. When I was 25, my net worth was $100 million or so. I decided then that I wasnt going to let it ruin my life. Theres no way you could ever spend it all, and I dont view wealth as something that validates my intelligence. ","At fifteen life had taught me undeniably that surrender, in its place, was as honorable as resistance, especially if one had no choice. ","If a man can bridge the gap between life and death, if he can live on after hes dead, then maybe he was a great man. ","Money cannot buy peace of mind. It cannot heal ruptured relationships, or build meaning into a life that has none. ","Above our life we love a steadfast friend. ","There is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it and no happiness in any place except what you bring to it yourself. ","While we have the gift of life, it seems to me the only tragedy is to allow part of us to die - whether it is our spirit, our creativity or our glorious uniqueness. ","I really believe that everyone has a talent, ability, or skill that he can mine to support himself and to succeed in life. ","There are two tragedies in life. One is to lose your hearts desire. The other is to gain it. ","I have found it easier to identify with the characters who verge upon hysteria, who were frightened of life, who were desperate to reach out to another person. But these seemingly fragile people are the strong people really. ","Life is all memory, except for the one present moment that goes by you so quickly you hardly catch it going. ","No matter what age you are, or what your circumstances might be, you are special, and you still have something unique to offer. Your life, because of who you are, has meaning. ","Photography takes an instant out of time, altering life by holding it still. ","I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor. ","If I were to say, God, why me? about the bad things, then I should have said, God, why me? about the good things that happened in my life. ","I was set free because my greatest fear had been realized, and I still had a daughter who I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became a solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. ","I really dont think life is about the I-could-have-beens. Life is only about the I-tried-to-do. I dont mind the failure but I cant imagine that Id forgive myself if I didnt try. ","What sweetness is left in life, if you take away friendship? Robbing life of friendship is like robbing the world of the sun. A true friend is more to be esteemed than kinsfolk. ","This is as true in everyday life as it is in battle: we are given one life and the decision is ours whether to wait for circumstances to make up our mind, or whether to act, and in acting, to live. ","Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives. Mans life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self. ","I believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear. ","Haters never win. I just think thats true about life, because negative energy always costs in the end. ","Life in general has never been even close to fair, so the pretense that the government can make it fair is a valuable and inexhaustible asset to politicians who want to expand government. ","Ive been absolutely terrified every moment of my life - and Ive never let it keep me from doing a single thing I wanted to do. ","Children make your life important. ","There is a very fine line between loving life and being greedy for it. ","Choice of attention - to pay attention to this and ignore that - is to the inner life what choice of action is to the outer. In both cases, a man is responsible for his choice and must accept the consequences, whatever they may be. ","I think togetherness is a very important ingredient to family life. ","I do not believe in excuses. I believe in hard work as the prime solvent of lifes problems. ","Ive always taken The Wizard of Oz very seriously, you know. I believe in the idea of the rainbow. And Ive spent my entire life trying to get over it. ","Life is too short to worry about anything. You had better enjoy it because the next day promises nothing. ","In life you need either inspiration or desperation. ","This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life. Finally, to take a step without feet. ","Honesty and integrity are absolutely essential for success in life - all areas of life. The really good news is that anyone can develop both honesty and integrity. ","A bachelors life is a fine breakfast, a flat lunch, and a miserable dinner. ","If you cannot work on the marriage or the women is a moron, staying married and cheating makes the most sense because divorce is disruptive to the family life and your bank account. ","In liberal logic, if life is unfair then the answer is to turn more tax money over to politicians, to spend in ways that will increase their chances of getting reelected. ","My general attitude to life is to enjoy every minute of every day. I never do anything with a feeling of, Oh God, Ive got to do this today. ","Without knowing what I am and why I am here, life is impossible. ","My focus is to forget the pain of life. Forget the pain, mock the pain, reduce it. And laugh. ","Life opens up opportunities to you, and you either take them or you stay afraid of taking them. ","Never build your emotional life on the weaknesses of others. ","What you get is a living, what you give is a life. ","The man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life. ","I lead no party; I follow no leader. I have given the best part of my life to careful study of Islam, its law and polity, its culture, its history and its literature. ","Im most proud of the blessings that God has bestowed upon me, in my life. Hes given me the vision to truly see that you can fall down, but you can still get back up. Hopefully Ill learn from my mistakes and have the opportunity to strengthen and improve the next thing I do. ","I have a loyalty that runs in my bloodstream, when I lock into someone or something, you cant get me away from it because I commit that thoroughly. Thats in friendship, thats a deal, thats a commitment. Dont give me paper - I can get the same lawyer who drew it up to break it. But if you shake my hand, thats for life. ","Find ecstasy in life; the mere sense of living is joy enough. ","When I am able to resist the temptation to judge others, I can see them as teachers of forgiveness in my life, reminding me that I can only have peace of mind when I forgive rather than judge. ","Just when I think I have learned the way to live, life changes. ","Life loves to be taken by the lapel and told: Im with you kid. Lets go. ","A lot of us grow up and we grow out of the literal interpretation that we get when were children, but we bear the scars all our life. Whether theyre scars of beauty or scars of ugliness, its pretty much in the eye of the beholder. ","Every life has a measure of sorrow, and sometimes this is what awakens us. ","Its surprising how many persons go through life without ever recognizing that their feelings toward other people are largely determined by their feelings toward themselves, and if youre not comfortable within yourself, you cant be comfortable with others. ","The tragedy of life is in what dies inside a man while he lives - the death of genuine feeling, the death of inspired response, the awareness that makes it possible to feel the pain or the glory of other men in yourself. ","He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. Is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves? ","Having Down syndrome is like being born normal. I am just like you and you are just like me. We are all born in different ways, that is the way I can describe it. I have a normal life. ","If you wish to succeed in life, make perseverance your bosom friend, experience your wise counselor, caution your elder brother, and hope your guardian genius. ","What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything? ","I know in my heart that man is good. That what is right will always eventually triumph.

","I have a great respect for incremental improvement, and Ive done that sort of thing in my life, but Ive always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes. I dont know why. Because theyre harder. Theyre much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that youve completely failed. ","Telling a teenager the facts of life is like giving a fish a bath. ","If I have any worth, it is to live my life for God so as to teach these peoples; even though some of them still look down on me.

If youre killed, youve lost a very important part of your life. ","Property is intended to serve life, and no matter how much we surround it with rights and respect, it has no personal being. It is part of the earth man walks on. It is not man.

Let them see that the important thing is not the object of love, but the emotion itself. ","What do you want a meaning for? Life is a desire, not a meaning. ","Life is too short to spend hoping that the perfectly arched eyebrow or hottest new lip shade will mask an ugly heart. ","The quality of life is more important than life itself. ","Even when a person has all of lifes comforts - good food, good shelter, a companion - he or she can still become unhappy when encountering a tragic situation. ","Words can never adequately convey the incredible impact of our attitudes toward life. The longer I live the more convinced I become that life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we respond to it. ","You make mistakes, but I dont have any regrets. Im the kind of person who takes responsibility for it and deals with it. I learn from everything I do. I work very hard, I have so many things going on in my life. Get to know me and see who I am.

","If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things.

","Is life not a thousand times too short for us to bore ourselves? ","Somebody should tell us, right at the start of our lives, that we are dying. Then we might live life to the limit, every minute of every day. Do it! I say. Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. ","Winning is great, sure, but if you are really going to do something in life, the secret is learning how to lose. Nobody goes undefeated all the time.

","It takes half your life before you discover life is a do-it-yourself project. ","And above all things, never think that youre not good enough yourself. A man should never think that. My belief is that in life people will take you at your own reckoning. ","I didnt see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. ","Do what you love to do and give it your very best. Whether its business or baseball, or the theater, or any field. If you dont love what youre doing and you cant give it your best, get out of it. Life is too short. Youll be an old man before you know it. ","My one regret in life is that I am not someone else. ","You must pass your days in song. Let your whole life be a song.

","Faith is the first factor in a life devoted to service. Without it, nothing is possible. With it, nothing is impossible.

Nor is a mans life perfect or whole till he has added to himself a wife. ","All mankind... being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions. ","I suppose thats one of the ironies of life doing the wrong thing at the right moment. ","He who is void of virtuous attachments in private life is, or very soon will be, void of all regard for his country. There is seldom an instance of a man guilty of betraying his country, who had not before lost the feeling of moral obligations in his private connections. ","Sometimes its the smallest decisions that can change your life forever. ","If you knew that your life was merely a phase or short, short segment of your entire existence, how would you live? Knowing nothing real was at risk, what would you do? Youd live a gigantic, bold, fun, dazzling life. You know you would. Thats what the ghosts want us to do - all the exciting things they no longer can. ","A friend is one who knows you and loves you just the same. ","Dont walk behind me; I may not lead. Dont walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend. ","An insincere and evil friend is more to be feared than a wild beast; a wild beast may wound your body, but an evil friend will wound your mind. ","Friendship... is not something you learn in school. But if you havent learned the meaning of friendship, you really havent learned anything. ","Lots of people want to ride with you in the limo, but what you want is someone who will take the bus with you when the limo breaks down. ","When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. ","A friend should be one in whose understanding and virtue we can equally confide, and whose opinion we can value at once for its justness and its sincerity. ","In everyones life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit. ","A true friend never gets in your way unless you happen to be going down. ","A friendship can weather most things and thrive in thin soil; but it needs a little mulch of letters and phone calls and small, silly presents every so often - just to save it from drying out completely. ","One of the most beautiful qualities of true friendship is to understand and to be understood. ","A single rose can be my garden... a single friend, my world. ","I value the friend who for me finds time on his calendar, but I cherish the friend who for me does not consult his calendar. ","True friends stab you in the front. ","Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence. ","Let us be grateful to people who make us happy, they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. ","Think where mans glory most begins and ends, and say my glory was I had such friends. ","A true friend freely, advises justly, assists readily, adventures boldly, takes all patiently, defends courageously, and continues a friend unchangeably. ","Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art... It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things that give value to survival. ","A friend is someone who gives you total freedom to be yourself. ","The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing... not healing, not curing... that is a friend who cares. ","A friend to all is a friend to none. ","Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies. ","It is one of the blessings of old friends that you can afford to be stupid with them. ","But friendship is precious, not only in the shade, but in the sunshine of life, and thanks to a benevolent arrangement the greater part of life is sunshine. ","Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light. ","Friends and good manners will carry you where money wont go. ","In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed. ","Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness. ","I cannot even imagine where I would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy. Lets face it, friends make life a lot more fun. ","A hug is like a boomerang - you get it back right away. ","A true friend is someone who is there for you when hed rather be anywhere else. ","Each friend represents a world in us, a world not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born. ","Am I not destroying my enemies when I make friends of them? ","I dont need a friend who changes when I change and who nods when I nod; my shadow does that much better. ","Never explain - your friends do not need it and your enemies will not believe you anyway. ","The friend in my adversity I shall always cherish most. I can better trust those who helped to relieve the gloom of my dark hours than those who are so ready to enjoy with me the sunshine of my prosperity. ","When you choose your friends, dont be short-changed by choosing personality over character. ","There is nothing on this earth more to be prized than true friendship. ","Rare as is true love, true friendship is rarer. ","It is only the great hearted who can be true friends. The mean and cowardly, Can never know what true friendship means. ","Be true to your work, your word, and your friend. ","A friendship founded on business is better than a business founded on friendship. ","The only way to have a friend is to be one. ","Men kick friendship around like a football, but it doesnt seem to crack. Women treat it like glass and it goes to pieces. ","My best friend is the man who in wishing me well wishes it for my sake. ","If its very painful for you to criticize your friends - youre safe in doing it. But if you take the slightest pleasure in it, thats the time to hold your tongue. ","Be slow to fall into friendship; but when thou art in, continue firm and constant. ","You can always tell a real friend: when youve made a fool of yourself he doesnt feel youve done a permanent job. ","Its the friends you can call up at 4 a.m. that matter. ","So long as the memory of certain beloved friends lives in my heart, I shall say that life is good. ","Never make friends with people who are above or below you in status. Such friendships will never give you any happiness. ","The friend is the man who knows all about you, and still likes you. ","I have friends in overalls whose friendship I would not swap for the favor of the kings of the world. ","The language of friendship is not words but meanings. ","Nothing but heaven itself is better than a friend who is really a friend. ","The greatest gift of life is friendship, and I have received it. ","My best friend is the one who brings out the best in me. ","Silences make the real conversations between friends. Not the saying but the never needing to say is what counts. ","She is a friend of mind. She gather me, man. The pieces I am, she gather them and give them back to me in all the right order. Its good, you know, when you got a woman who is a friend of your mind. ","A true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your success! ","Friendship and money: oil and water. ","The sincere friends of this world are as ship lights in the stormiest of nights. ","The most I can do for my friend is simply be his friend. ","We call that person who has lost his father, an orphan; and a widower that man who has lost his wife. But that man who has known the immense unhappiness of losing a friend, by what name do we call him? Here every language is silent and holds its peace in impotence. ","Our friends interpret the world and ourselves to us, if we take them tenderly and truly. ","The world is round so that friendship may encircle it. ","Friends... they cherish one anothers hopes. They are kind to one anothers dreams. ","A friend is one who walks in when others walk out. ","There is a magnet in your heart that will attract true friends. That magnet is unselfishness, thinking of others first; when you learn to live for others, they will live for you. ","There is some self-interest behind every friendship. There is no friendship without self-interests. This is a bitter truth. ","Wishing to be friends is quick work, but friendship is a slow ripening fruit. ","A true friend is the greatest of all blessings, and that which we take the least care of all to acquire. ","It is more shameful to distrust our friends than to be deceived by them. ","Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing. There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when its all over. ","No person is your friend who demands your silence, or denies your right to grow. ","Lovers have a right to betray you... friends dont. ","If instead of a gem, or even a flower, we should cast the gift of a loving thought into the heart of a friend, that would be giving as the angels give. ","I always felt that the great high privilege, relief and comfort of friendship was that one had to explain nothing. ","A quarrel between friends, when made up, adds a new tie to friendship. ","Friendship is one mind in two bodies. ","If you have one true friend you have more than your share. ","It takes a long time to grow an old friend. ","Love is blind; friendship closes its eyes. ","True friendship can afford true knowledge. It does not depend on darkness and ignorance. ","An excellent man; he has no enemies; and none of his friends like him. ","Friendship multiplies the good of life and divides the evil. ","It is not so much our friends help that helps us, as the confidence of their help. ","A mans growth is seen in the successive choirs of his friends. ","Fear makes strangers of people who would be friends. ","A friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature. ","But friendship is the breathing rose, with sweets in every fold. ","Friendship needs no words - it is solitude delivered from the anguish of loneliness. ","Friendship is held to be the severest test of character. It is easy, we think, to be loyal to a family and clan, whose blood is in your own veins. ","Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love. ","Some people go to priests; others to poetry; I to my friends. ","What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies. ","Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one. ","Yesm, old friends is always best, less you can catch a new one thats fit to make an old one out of. ","A friend is, as it were, a second self. ","As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend. ","The real test of friendship is: can you literally do nothing with the other person? Can you enjoy those moments of life that are utterly simple? ","He who hath many friends hath none. ","I have learned that to be with those I like is enough. ","He has no enemies, but is intensely disliked by his friends. ","A mans friendships are one of the best measures of his worth. ","Be slow in choosing a friend, slower in changing.

","Since there is nothing so well worth having as friends, never lose a chance to make them. ","Cherish your human connections: your relationships with friends and family. ","Let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit. ","Many a person has held close, throughout their entire lives, two friends that always remained strange to one another, because one of them attracted by virtue of similarity, the other by difference. ","To avoid being mistaken for a sellout, I chose my friends carefully. The more politically active black students. The foreign students. The Chicanos. The Marxist professors and structural feminists and punk-rock performance poets. ","Rejoicing in our joy, not suffering over our suffering, makes someone a friend. ","Friendship at first sight, like love at first sight, is said to be the only truth. ","Sweet is the memory of distant friends! Like the mellow rays of the departing sun, it falls tenderly, yet sadly, on the heart. ","It is important to our friends to believe that we are unreservedly frank with them, and important to friendship that we are not. ","All you need to do to be my friend is like me. ","Never contract friendship with a man that is not better than thyself. ","Friendship improves happiness and abates misery, by the doubling of our joy and the dividing of our grief. ","There is no friend like an old friend who has shared our morning days, no greeting like his welcome, no homage like his praise. ","Life has no blessing like a prudent friend. ","It seems to me that trying to live without friends is like milking a bear to get cream for your morning coffee. It is a whole lot of trouble, and then not worth much after you get it. ","Ones friends are that part of the human race with which one can be human. ","Love demands infinitely less than friendship. ","When a friend is in trouble, dont annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do. Think up something appropriate and do it. ","Instead of loving your enemies - treat your friends a little better. ","Nothing so fortifies a friendship as a belief on the part of one friend that he is superior to the other.

","The best time to make friends is before you need them. ","That friendship will not continue to the end which is begun for an end. ","Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable. ","Were born alone, we live alone, we die alone. Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that were not alone. ","Friendship is always a sweet responsibility, never an opportunity. ","It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages. ","Love is friendship that has caught fire. It is quiet understanding, mutual confidence, sharing and forgiving. It is loyalty through good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses. ","Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship - never. ","If we listened to our intellect, wed never have a love affair. Wed never have a friendship. Wed never go into business, because wed be cynical. Well, thats nonsense. Youve got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down. ","Between men and women there is no friendship possible. There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship. ","Be true to yourself, help others, make each day your masterpiece, make friendship a fine art, drink deeply from good books - especially the Bible, build a shelter against a rainy day, give thanks for your blessings and pray for guidance every day. ","True friendship multiplies the good in life and divides its evils. Strive to have friends, for life without friends is like life on a desert island... to find one real friend in a lifetime is good fortune; to keep him is a blessing. ","A friendship that like love is warm; A love like friendship, steady. ","True friendship ought never to conceal what it thinks. ","Friendship is the shadow of the evening, which increases with the setting sun of life. ","All lasting business is built on friendship. ","The two most misused words in the entire English vocabulary are love and friendship. A true friend would die for you, so when you start trying to count them on one hand, you dont need any fingers. ","I think its important to have closure in any relationship that ends - from a romantic relationship to a friendship. You should always have a sense of clarity at the end and know why it began and why it ended. You need that in your life to move cleanly into your next phase. ","True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity, before it is entitled to the appellation. ","A tree is known by its fruit; a man by his deeds. A good deed is never lost; he who sows courtesy reaps friendship, and he who plants kindness gathers love. ","Friendship may, and often does, grow into love, but love never subsides into friendship. ","False friendship, like the ivy, decays and ruins the walls it embraces; but true friendship gives new life and animation to the object it supports. ","The greatest healing therapy is friendship and love. ","Love is a friendship set to music. ","A woman may very well form a friendship with a man, but for this to endure, it must be assisted by a little physical antipathy. ","Ones life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, indignation and compassion. ","The rule of friendship means there should be mutual sympathy between them, each supplying what the other lacks and trying to benefit the other, always using friendly and sincere words. ","Depth of friendship does not depend on length of acquaintance. ","Friendship with ones self is all important, because without it one cannot be friends with anyone else in the world. ","Peace and friendship with all mankind is our wisest policy, and I wish we may be permitted to pursue it. ","Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing. ","Friendship is a pretty full-time occupation if you really are friendly with somebody. You cant have too many friends because then youre just not really friends. ","Eros will have naked bodies; Friendship naked personalities. ","True friendship is like sound health; the value of it is seldom known until it is lost. ","The essence of true friendship is to make allowance for anothers little lapses. ","Dad needs to show an incredible amount of respect and humor and friendship toward his mate so the kids understand their parents are sexy, theyre fun, they do things together, theyre best friends. Kids learn by example. If I respect Mom, theyre going to respect Mom. ","Dont flatter yourself that friendship authorizes you to say disagreeable things to your intimates. The nearer you come into relation with a person, the more necessary do tact and courtesy become. ","What sweetness is left in life, if you take away friendship? Robbing life of friendship is like robbing the world of the sun. A true friend is more to be esteemed than kinsfolk. ","I have a loyalty that runs in my bloodstream, when I lock into someone or something, you cant get me away from it because I commit that thoroughly. Thats in friendship, thats a deal, thats a commitment. Dont give me paper - I can get the same lawyer who drew it up to break it. But if you shake my hand, thats for life. ","Friendship is two-sided. It isnt a friend just because someones doing something nice for you. Thats a nice person. Theres friendship when you do for each other. Its like marriage - its two-sided. ","Friendship is Love without his wings! ","There is no friendship, no love, like that of the parent for the child. ","If there is such a thing as a good marriage, it is because it resembles friendship rather than love. ","What men have called friendship is only a social arrangement, a mutual adjustment of interests, an interchange of services given and received; it is, in sum, simply a business from which those involved propose to derive a steady profit for their own self-love. ","Sympathy constitutes friendship; but in love there is a sort of antipathy, or opposing passion. Each strives to be the other, and both together make up one whole. ","Loyalty and friendship, which is to me the same, created all the wealth that Ive ever thought Id have. ","Friendship is but another name for an alliance with the follies and the misfortunes of others. Our own share of miseries is sufficient: why enter then as volunteers into those of another? ","Friendship is the source of the greatest pleasures, and without friends even the most agreeable pursuits become tedious. ","However rare true love may be, it is less so than true friendship. ","Caring for but never trying to own may be a further way to define friendship. ","Love is friendship set on fire. ","It is one of the severest tests of friendship to tell your friend his faults. So to love a man that you cannot bear to see a stain upon him, and to speak painful truth through loving words, that is friendship. ","Even in the common affairs of life, in love, friendship, and marriage, how little security have we when we trust our happiness in the hands of others! ","No matter what message you are about to deliver somewhere, whether it is holding out a hand of friendship, or making clear that you disapprove of something, is the fact that the person sitting across the table is a human being, so the goal is to always establish common ground. ","Real friendship, like real poetry, is extremely rare - and precious as a pearl. ","My parents, and librarians along the way, taught me about the space between words; about the margins, where so many juicy moments of life and spirit and friendship could be found. In a library, you could find miracles and truth and you might find something that would make you laugh so hard that you get shushed, in the friendliest way. ","The fact is, with every friendship you make, and every bond of trust you establish, you are shaping the image of America projected to the rest of the world. That is so important. So when you study abroad, youre actually helping to make America stronger. ","If one of two lovers is loyal, and the other jealous and false, how may their friendship last, for Love is slain! ","Friendship is a plant of slow growth and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation. ","Perfect friendship is the friendship of men who are good, and alike in excellence; for these wish well alike to each other qua good, and they are good in themselves. ","One friend in a lifetime is much, two are many, three are hardly possible. Friendship needs a certain parallelism of life, a community of thought, a rivalry of aim. ","Fan the sinking flame of hilarity with the wing of friendship; and pass the rosy wine. ","Friendship, like love, is destroyed by long absence, though it may be increased by short intermissions. ","Love, friendship and respect do not unite people as much as a common hatred for something. ","Friendship is like money, easier made than kept. ","True happiness arises, in the first place, from the enjoyment of ones self, and in the next, from the friendship and conversation of a few select companions. ","If we are to judge of love by its consequences, it more nearly resembles hatred than friendship. ","There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man. ","Peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations; entangling alliances with none. ","No distance of place or lapse of time can lessen the friendship of those who are thoroughly persuaded of each others worth. ","But it all comes down to friendship, treating people right. ","Of all the things which wisdom provides to make us entirely happy, much the greatest is the possession of friendship. ","If a man does not make new acquaintances as he advances through life, he will soon find himself left alone. A man, sir, should keep his friendship in a constant repair.

And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest, are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second. ","Just as a candle cannot burn without fire, men cannot live without a spiritual life.

Its true that men who cry are sensitive to and in touch with feelings, but the only feelings they tend to be sensitive to and in touch with are their own.

","Of all religions, the Christian should of course inspire the most tolerance, but until now Christians have been the most intolerant of all men. ","Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. The savages whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man free from men.

","Timid men prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of liberty. ","I think God made a woman to be strong and not to be trampled under the feet of men. Ive always felt this way because my mother was a very strong woman, without a husband. ","Reflect upon your present blessings of which every man has many - not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some. ","Justice means minding ones own business and not meddling with other mens concerns. ","Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory. ","There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty. ","The greatest enemy to human souls is the self-righteous spirit which makes men look to themselves for salvation. ","Reputation is what men and women think of us; character is what God and angels know of us. ","All mens miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone. ","We are so obsessed with doing that we have no time and no imagination left for being. As a result, men are valued not for what they are but for what they do or what they have - for their usefulness. ","Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be true or not, I can say for one that I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem. ","When freedom does not have a purpose, when it does not wish to know anything about the rule of law engraved in the hearts of men and women, when it does not listen to the voice of conscience, it turns against humanity and society. ","Welcome to Lake Wobegon, where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average. ","Im fed up to the ears with old men dreaming up wars for young men to die in. ","Deprived of meaningful work, men and women lose their reason for existence; they go stark, raving mad. ","Men are so simple and so much inclined to obey immediate needs that a deceiver will never lack victims for his deceptions. ","All women have a perception much more developed than men. So all women somehow, being repressed for so many millennia, they ended up by developing this sixth sense and contemplation and love. And this is something that we have a hard time to accept as part of our society. ","Men are born ignorant, not stupid. They are made stupid by education. ","Men should be either treated generously or destroyed, because they take revenge for slight injuries - for heavy ones they cannot. ","Adversity makes men, and prosperity makes monsters. ","Great hopes make great men. ","All men are born with a nose and ten fingers, but no one was born with a knowledge of God. ","As our enemies have found we can reason like men, so now let us show them we can fight like men also. ","The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need men who can dream of things that never were. ","I have known a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in the face. Dont trust that conventional idea. Dishonesty will stare honesty out of countenance any day in the week, if there is anything to be got by it. ","An invincible determination can accomplish almost anything and in this lies the great distinction between great men and little men. ","We have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men. ","Capitalism is the astounding belief that the most wickedest of men will do the most wickedest of things for the greatest good of everyone. ","The Hebrews have done more to civilize men than any other nation. If I were an atheist, and believed blind eternal fate, I should still believe that fate had ordained the Jews to be the most essential instrument for civilizing the nations. ","When Jesus comes back, these crazy, greedy, capitalistic men are gonna kill him again. ","Smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women. ","The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ","People who have no hold over their process of thinking are likely to be ruined by liberty of thought. If thought is immature, liberty of thought becomes a method of converting men into animals. ","Women must tell men always that they are the strong ones. They are the big, the strong, the wonderful. In truth, women are the strong ones. It is just my opinion, I am not a professor. ","Content makes poor men rich; discontent makes rich men poor. ","It is in the character of very few men to honor without envy a friend who has prospered. ","When women go wrong, men go right after them. ","Do not share the knowledge with which you have been blessed with everyone in general, as you do with some people in particular; and know that there are some men in whom Allah, may He he glorified, has placed hidden secrets, which they are forbidden to reveal. ","Heaven and hell suppose two distinct species of men, the good and the bad. But the greatest part of mankind float betwixt vice and virtue. ","It is not titles that honor men, but men that honor titles. ","We have guided missiles and misguided men. ","Men are only as loyal as their options. ","Dont wait for extraordinary opportunities. Seize common occasions and make them great. Weak men wait for opportunities; strong men make them. ","Tears are often the telescope by which men see far into heaven. ","All brave men love; for he only is brave who has affections to fight for, whether in the daily battle of life, or in physical contests. ","I will not be concerned at other mens not knowing me;I will be concerned at my own want of ability. ","Guys are simple... women are not simple and they always assume that men must be just as complicated as they are, only way more mysterious. The whole point is guys are not thinking much. They are just what they appear to be. Tragically. ","Fishes live in the sea, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the little ones. ","No man has the right to dictate what other men should perceive, create or produce, but all should be encouraged to reveal themselves, their perceptions and emotions, and to build confidence in the creative spirit. ","History does nothing; it does not possess immense riches, it does not fight battles. It is men, real, living, who do all this. ","Im supposed to have a Ph.D. on the subject of women. But the truth is Ive flunked more often than not. Im very fond of women; I admire them. But, like all men, I dont understand them. ","But while they prate of economic laws, men and women are starving. We must lay hold of the fact that economic laws are not made by nature. They are made by human beings. ","Ten men waiting for me at the door? Send one of them home, Im tired. ","All the problems of the world could be settled easily if men were only willing to think. The trouble is that men very often resort to all sorts of devices in order not to think, because thinking is such hard work. ","Choose silence of all virtues, for by it you hear other mens imperfections, and conceal your own. ","If we take the generally accepted definition of bravery as a quality which knows no fear, I have never seen a brave man. All men are frightened. The more intelligent they are, the more they are frightened. ","For evil to flourish, it only requires good men to do nothing. ","I cannot help fearing that men may reach a point where they look on every new theory as a danger, every innovation as a toilsome trouble, every social advance as a first step toward revolution, and that they may absolutely refuse to move at all. ","Women cannot complain about men anymore until they start getting better taste in them. ","Ive yet to be on a campus where most women werent worrying about some aspect of combining marriage, children, and a career. Ive yet to find one where many men were worrying about the same thing. ","Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction. ","How absurd men are! They never use the liberties they have, they demand those they do not have. They have freedom of thought, they demand freedom of speech. ","We cannot live only for ourselves. A thousand fibers connect us with our fellow men. ","It is funny that men who are supposed to be scientific cannot get themselves to realise the basic principle of physics, that action and reaction are equal and opposite, that when you persecute people you always rouse them to be strong and stronger. ","There can never be peace between nations until there is first known that true peace which is within the souls of men. ","All men are prepared to accomplish the incredible if their ideals are threatened. ","Wealthy men cant live in an island that is encircled by poverty. We all breathe the same air. We must give a chance to everyone, at least a basic chance. ","Great men are they who see that spiritual is stronger than any material force - that thoughts rule the world. ","The megalomaniac differs from the narcissist by the fact that he wishes to be powerful rather than charming, and seeks to be feared rather than loved. To this type belong many lunatics and most of the great men of history. ","An association of men who will not quarrel with one another is a thing which has never yet existed, from the greatest confederacy of nations down to a town meeting or a vestry. ","Men must be governed by God or they will be ruled by tyrants. ","Force always attracts men of low morality. ","I dont know why women want any of the things men have when one the things that women have is men. ","If God listened to the prayers of men, all men would quickly have perished: for they are forever praying for evil against one another. ","The big divide in this country is not between Democrats and Republicans, or women and men, but between talkers and doers. ","All men who have achieved great things have been great dreamers. ","If any civilization is to survive, it is the morality of altruism that men have to reject. ","Men dont care whats on TV. They only care what else is on TV. ","Let me embrace thee, sour adversity, for wise men say it is the wisest course. ","Men are April when they woo, December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. ","If men can develop weapons that are so terrifying as to make the thought of global war include almost a sentence for suicide, you would think that mans intelligence and his comprehension... would include also his ability to find a peaceful solution. ","Lives of great men all remind us, we can make our lives sublime, and, departing, leave behind us, footprints on the sands of time. ","The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. ","The tragedy of life is in what dies inside a man while he lives - the death of genuine feeling, the death of inspired response, the awareness that makes it possible to feel the pain or the glory of other men in yourself. ","All men are children, and of one family. The same tale sends them all to bed, and wakes them in the morning. ","The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for white, or women created for men. ","If women are supposed to be less rational and more emotional at the beginning of our menstrual cycle when the female hormone is at its lowest level, then why isnt it logical to say that, in those few days, women behave the most like the way men behave all month long? ","Men of ill judgment ignore the good that lies within their hands, till they have lost it. ","When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle. ","Some men know that a light touch of the tongue, running from a womans toes to her ears, lingering in the softest way possible in various places in between, given often enough and sincerely enough, would add immeasurably to world peace. ","All wars are civil wars, because all men are brothers. ","If women were particular about mens characters, they would never get married at all. ","Little men with little minds and little imaginations go through life in little ruts, smugly resisting all changes which would jar their little worlds. ","I have no fear that the result of our experiment will be that men may be trusted to govern themselves without a master. ","What men have called friendship is only a social arrangement, a mutual adjustment of interests, an interchange of services given and received; it is, in sum, simply a business from which those involved propose to derive a steady profit for their own self-love. ","The assertion that all men are created equal was of no practical use in effecting our separation from Great Britain and it was placed in the Declaration not for that, but for future use. ","I think people are born bisexual and the make subconscious choices based on the pressures of society. I have no question in my mind about being bisexual. But Im also a hypocrite: I would never date a girl who is bisexual, because that means they also sleep with men, and men are so dirty that Id never sleep with a girl who had slept with a man. ","The truth is not for all men, but only for those who seek it. ","You know that being an American is more than a matter of where your parents came from. It is a belief that all men are created free and equal and that everyone deserves an even break. ","Men are moved by two levers only: fear and self interest. ","I will not attack your doctrines nor your creeds if they accord liberty to me. If they hold thought to be dangerous - if they aver that doubt is a crime, then I attack them one and all, because they enslave the minds of men. ","Study strategy over the years and achieve the spirit of the warrior. Today is victory over yourself of yesterday; tomorrow is your victory over lesser men. ","I am looking for a lot of men who have an infinite capacity to not know what cant be done. ","Why are women... so much more interesting to men than men are to women? ","All religions have been made by men. ","Men are more moral than they think and far more immoral than they can imagine. ","God is in all men, but all men are not in God; that is why we suffer. ","Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it. ","I believe in the brotherhood of all men, but I dont believe in wasting brotherhood on anyone who doesnt want to practice it with me. Brotherhood is a two-way street. ","Men who are in earnest are not afraid of consequences. ","All men by nature desire knowledge. ","I have never found a companion that was so companionable as solitude. We are for the most part more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our chambers. A man thinking or working is always alone, let him be where he will. ","Baseball players are smarter than football players. How often do you see a baseball team penalized for too many men on the field? ","I have been astonished that men could die martyrs for religion - I have shuddered at it. I shudder no more - I could be martyred for my religion - Love is my religion - I could die for that. ","What I would say to the young men and women who are beset by hopelessness and doubt is that they should go and see what is being done on the ground to fight poverty, not like going to the zoo but to take action, to open their hearts and their consciences. ","The highest prize in a world of men is the most beautiful woman available on your arm and living there in her heart loyal to you. ","As soon as men decide that all means are permitted to fight an evil, then their good becomes indistinguishable from the evil that they set out to destroy. ","Ive also seen that great men are often lonely. This is understandable, because they have built such high standards for themselves that they often feel alone. But that same loneliness is part of their ability to create. ","All men and women have an equal need for love. When these needs are not fulfilled it is easy to have our feelings hurt, for which we blame our partner. ","There are many men of principle in both parties in America, but there is no party of principle. ","Education is that whole system of human training within and without the school house walls, which molds and develops men. ","The majority of men meet with failure because of their lack of persistence in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail. ","Instead of comparing our lot with that of those who are more fortunate than we are, we should compare it with the lot of the great majority of our fellow men. It then appears that we are among the privileged. ","In America everybody is of the opinion that he has no social superiors, since all men are equal, but he does not admit that he has no social inferiors, for, from the time of Jefferson onward, the doctrine that all men are equal applies only upwards, not downwards. ","That men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history. ","Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves; they therefore remain bound. ","How is it they live in such harmony the billions of stars - when most men can barely go a minute without declaring war in their minds about someone they know. ","I saw six men kicking and punching the mother-in-law. My neighbour said Are you going to help? I said No, six should be enough. ","Theres no evidence whatsoever that men are more rational than women. Both sexes seem to be equally irrational. ","Boxing is a lot of white men watching two black men beat each other up. ","Death is not the worst that can happen to men. ","Our defense is in the preservation of the spirit which prizes liberty as a heritage of all men, in all lands, everywhere. Destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of despotism around your own doors. ","People who know little are usually great talkers, while men who know much say little. ","But men are men; the best sometimes forget. ","Democracy arises out of the notion that those who are equal in any respect are equal in all respects; because men are equally free, they claim to be absolutely equal. ","Men do not have to cook their food; they do so for symbolic reasons to show they are men and not beasts. ","There are only two kinds of men: the righteous who think they are sinners and the sinners who think they are righteous. ","Books constitute capital. A library book lasts as long as a house, for hundreds of years. It is not, then, an article of mere consumption but fairly of capital, and often in the case of professional men, setting out in life, it is their only capital. ","You can tell the strength of a nation by the women behind its men. ","A little group of willful men, representing no opinion but their own, have rendered the great government of the United States helpless and contemptible. ","Why do you think the old stories tell of men who set out on great journeys to impress the gods? Because trying to impress people just isnt worth the time and effort. ","Men are like wine - some turn to vinegar, but the best improve with age. ","A vigorous temper is not altogether an evil. Men who are easy as an old shoe are generally of little worth. ","Bachelors have consciences, married men have wives. ","Thank God men cannot fly, and lay waste the sky as well as the earth. ","Men are governed by lines of intellect - women: by curves of emotion. ","Men are liars. Well lie about lying if we have to. Im an algebra liar. I figure two good lies make a positive. ","I like being a woman, even in a mans world. After all, men cant wear dresses, but we can wear the pants. ","A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men. ","Republicans are men of narrow vision, who are afraid of the future. ","All men of action are dreamers. ","If men were angels, no government would be necessary. ","A man is ethical only when life, as such, is sacred to him, that of plants and animals as that of his fellow men, and when he devotes himself helpfully to all life that is in need of help. ","The danger of the past was that men became slaves. The danger of the future is that man may become robots. ","A lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns. ","A great deal of talent is lost to the world for want of a little courage. Every day sends to their graves obscure men whose timidity prevented them from making a first effort. ","Men ought either to be indulged or utterly destroyed, for if you merely offend them they take vengeance, but if you injure them greatly they are unable to retaliate, so that the injury done to a man ought to be such that vengeance cannot be feared. ","A man is a god in ruins. When men are innocent, life shall be longer, and shall pass into the immortal, as gently as we awake from dreams. ","I do not consider it an insult, but rather a compliment to be called an agnostic. I do not pretend to know where many ignorant men are sure - that is all that agnosticism means. ","It is not in the nature of politics that the best men should be elected. The best men do not want to govern their fellowmen. ","Men cheat for the same reason that dogs lick their balls... because they can. ","A good boss makes his men realize they have more ability than they think they have so that they consistently do better work than they thought they could. ","Men who have a pierced ear are better prepared for marriage - theyve experienced pain and bought jewelry. ","I do not wish women to have power over men; but over themselves. ","Not only our future economic soundness but the very soundness of our democratic institutions depends on the determination of our government to give employment to idle men. ","A chief is a man who assumes responsibility. He says I was beaten, he does not say My men were beaten. ","The wish to acquire more is admittedly a very natural and common thing; and when men succeed in this they are always praised rather than condemned. But when they lack the ability to do so and yet want to acquire more at all costs, they deserve condemnation for their mistakes. ","Plain women know more about men than beautiful women do. ","The most pitiful among men is he who turns his dreams into silver and gold. ","Bad men are full of repentance. ","The punishment which the wise suffer who refuse to take part in the government, is to live under the government of worse men. ","Grown men can learn from very little children for the hearts of little children are pure. Therefore, the Great Spirit may show to them many things which older people miss. ","When men attempt bold gestures, generally its considered romantic. When women do it, its often considered desperate or psycho. ","Ignorant men dont know what good they hold in their hands until theyve flung it away. ","What makes a woman beautiful is her loyalty to and her friendships with other women, and her honesty with men. ","English culture is basically homosexual in the sense that the men only really care about other men. ","Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. ","Men are able to trust one another, knowing the exact degree of dishonesty they are entitled to expect. ","It is not history which uses men as a means of achieving - as if it were an individual person - its own ends. History is nothing but the activity of men in pursuit of their ends. ","Few men have virtue to withstand the highest bidder. ","Of all the men that have run for president in the twentieth century, only George McGovern truly understood what a monument America could be to the human race. ","All men are created equal, it is only men themselves who place themselves above equality. ","My weaknesses have always been food and men - in that order. ","The planter, the farmer, the mechanic, and the laborer... form the great body of the people of the United States, they are the bone and sinew of the country men who love liberty and desire nothing but equal rights and equal laws. ","Older men declare war. But it is the youth that must fight and die. ","You will find men who want to be carried on the shoulders of others, who think that the world owes them a living. They dont seem to see that we must all lift together and pull together. ","We should not fret for what is past, nor should we be anxious about the future; men of discernment deal only with the present moment. ","Being a woman is a terribly difficult task, since it consists principally in dealing with men. ","Punishment is now unfashionable... because it creates moral distinctions among men, which, to the democratic mind, are odious. We prefer a meaningless collective guilt to a meaningful individual responsibility. ","These men ask for just the same thing, fairness, and fairness only. This, so far as in my power, they, and all others, shall have. ","Women are never disarmed by compliments. Men always are. That is the difference between the sexes. ","Great men, unknown to their generation, have their fame among the great who have preceded them, and all true worldly fame subsides from their high estimate beyond the stars. ","Girls we love for what they are; young men for what they promise to be. ","Those who want the Government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide to avoid assassination. ","Power does not corrupt men; fools, however, if they get into a position of power, corrupt power. ","Some of my best leading men have been dogs and horses. ","Men and women belong to different species and communications between them is still in its infancy. ","Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of husbands. Remember all men would be tyrants if they could. ","When we tire of well-worn ways, we seek for new. This restless craving in the souls of men spurs them to climb, and to seek the mountain view. ","All men profess honesty as long as they can. To believe all men honest would be folly. To believe none so is something worse. ","Its not the men in my life that count, its the life in my men. ","History has taught us over and over again that freedom is not free. When push comes to shove, the ultimate protectors of freedom and liberty are the brave men and women in our armed forces. Throughout our history, theyve answered the call in bravery and sacrifice. ","Stupid as a man, say the women: cowardly as a woman, say the men. Stupidity in a woman is unwomanly. ","There is no such thing as society: there are individual men and women, and there are families. ","The important thing is that men should have a purpose in life. It should be something useful, something good. ","These are the times that try mens souls. ","I dont think feminism, as I understand the definition, implies the rejection of maternal values, nurturing children, caring about the men in your life. That is just nonsense to me. ","If we are marked to die, we are enough to do our country loss; and if to live, the fewer men, the greater share of honor. ","While civilization has been improving our houses, it has not equally improved the men who are to inhabit them. It has created palaces, but it was not so easy to create noblemen and kings. ","Faith, there hath been many great men that have flattered the people who neer loved them. ","Men think highly of those who rise rapidly in the world; whereas nothing rises quicker than dust, straw, and feathers. ","I was ecstatic they re-named French Fries as Freedom Fries. Grown men and women in positions of power in the U.S. government showing themselves as idiots. ","Our forces saved the remnants of the Jewish people of Europe for a new life and a new hope in the reborn land of Israel. Along with all men of good will, I salute the young state and wish it well. ","As far as men go, it is not what they are that interests me, but what they can become. ","CNN found that Hillary Clinton is the most admired woman in America. Women admire her because shes strong and successful. Men admire her because she allows her husband to cheat and get away with it. ","There is always inequality in life. Some men are killed in a war and some men are wounded and some men never leave the country. Life is unfair. ","I do not consider divorce an evil by any means. It is just as much a refuge for women married to brutal men as Canada was to the slaves of brutal masters. ","Not necessity, not desire - no, the love of power is the demon of men. Let them have everything - health, food, a place to live, entertainment - they are and remain unhappy and low-spirited: for the demon waits and waits and will be satisfied. ","As soon as laws are necessary for men, they are no longer fit for freedom. ","Men have become the tools of their tools. ","Brave men rejoice in adversity, just as brave soldiers triumph in war. ","Men are so simple and yield so readily to the desires of the moment that he who will trick will always find another who will suffer to be tricked.

You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. ","Nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing. ","Men do not shape destiny, Destiny produces the man for the hour.

","I have a total irreverence for anything connected with society except that which makes the roads safer, the beer stronger, the food cheaper and the old men and old women warmer in the winter and happier in the summer. ","Women have simple tastes. They get pleasure out of the conversation of children in arms and men in love. ","Fires cant be made with dead embers, nor can enthusiasm be stirred by spiritless men. Enthusiasm in our daily work lightens effort and turns even labor into pleasant tasks. ","Reasonable men adapt to the world around them; unreasonable men make the world adapt to them. The world is changed by unreasonable men. ","And remember, where you have a concentration of power in a few hands, all too frequently men with the mentality of gangsters get control. History has proven that. ","A strong argument for the religion of Christ is this - that offences against Charity are about the only ones which men on their death-beds can be made - not to understand - but to feel - as crime.

","It is past time for women to take their rightful place, side by side with men, in the rooms where the fates of peoples, where their childrens and grandchildrens fates, are decided. ","As far as the men who are running for president are concerned, they arent even people I would date. ","As long as man continues to be the ruthless destroyer of lower living beings he will never know health or peace. For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. ","We must make it clear that a platform of I hate gay men and women is not a way to become president of the United States. ","A great value of antiquity lies in the fact that its writings are the only ones that modern men still read with exactness. ","Anger makes dull men witty, but it keeps them poor. ","But the problem is that when I go around and speak on campuses, I still dont get young men standing up and saying, How can I combine career and family? ","As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce. ","A time will come when a politician who has willfully made war and promoted international dissension will be as sure of the dock and much surer of the noose than a private homicide. It is not reasonable that those who gamble with mens lives should not stake their own. ","Mens actions are too strong for them. Show me a man who has acted, and who has not been the victim and slave of his action. ","Evil men have no songs. How is it that the Russians have songs? ","The belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every wickedness. ","Let men see, let them know, a real man, who lives as he was meant to live. ","Big jobs usually go to the men who prove their ability to outgrow small ones. ","Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control mens minds. ","I do not believe in God; his existence has been disproved by Science. But in the concentration camp, I learned to believe in men. ","Now the reason the enlightened prince and the wise general conquer the enemy whenever they move and their achievements surpass those of ordinary men is foreknowledge. ","We need more of the Office Desk and less of the Show Window in politics. Let men in office substitute the midnight oil for the limelight.

","Men are born with two eyes, but with one tongue, in order that they should see twice as much as they say. ","All mens misfortunes spring from their hatred of being alone. ","A government of laws, and not of men. ","When small men attempt great enterprises, they always end by reducing them to the level of their mediocrity. ","The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men. ","Men talk of killing time, while time quietly kills them. ","Money is the worst currency that ever grew among mankind. This sacks cities, this drives men from their homes, this teaches and corrupts the worthiest minds to turn base deeds. ","I have no ambition to govern men; it is a painful and thankless office. ","If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor mens cottage princes palaces. ","Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps, down new roads, armed with nothing but their own vision. ","Men know everything - all of them - all the time - no matter how stupid or inexperienced or arrogant or ignorant they are.

","To judge from the notions expounded by theologians, one must conclude that God created most men simply with a view to crowding hell. ","Christian virtues unite men. Racism separates them. ","Some of us are becoming the men we wanted to marry. ","A revival does two things. First, it returns the Church from her backsliding and second, it causes the conversion of men and women; and it always includes the conviction of sin on the part of the Church. What a spell the devil seems to cast over the Church today! ","I get along with guys; most of my friends are guys. Its easier to trust men sometimes. I only have a few close girlfriends that I trust. ","Rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of wise men. ","One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men. No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man. ","Foolish men imagine that because judgment for an evil thing is delayed, there is no justice; but only accident here below. Judgment for an evil thing is many times delayed some day or two, some century or two, but it is sure as life, it is sure as death. ","Death, so called, is a thing which makes men weep, And yet a third of life is passed in sleep. ","Time is the most valuable thing on earth: time to think, time to act, time to extend our fraternal relations, time to become better men, time to become better women, time to become better and more independent citizens. ","It is easier to lead men to combat, stirring up their passion, than to restrain them and direct them toward the patient labors of peace. ","Almost all the noblest things that have been achieved in the world, have been achieved by poor men; poor scholars, poor professional men, poor artisans and artists, poor philosophers, poets, and men of genius. ","Men love to wonder, and that is the seed of science. ","Girls have an unfair advantage over men: if they cant get what they want by being smart, they can get it by being dumb. ","There is one kind of robber whom the law does not strike at, and who steals what is most precious to men: time. ","Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe. ","Never respect men merely for their riches, but rather for their philanthropy; we do not value the sun for its height, but for its use. ","Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the conditions of men, the balance-wheel of the social machinery. ","It takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good. ","All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin. And therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words Ich bin ein Berliner! ","As long as men are free to ask what they must, free to say what they think, free to think what they will, freedom can never be lost and science can never regress. ","Every man is born as many men and dies as a single one. ","Too often the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men, or so completely dominated by them that whatever of special value women have to offer is shunted aside without expression. ","Things that I felt absolutely sure of but a few years ago, I do not believe now. This thought makes me see more clearly how foolish it would be to expect all men to agree with me. ","The story of the human race is the story of men and women selling themselves short. ","If you want to give up the admiration of thousands of men for the distain of one, go ahead, get married. ","The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that men will begin to think like computers. ","Much may be done in those little shreds and patches of time which every day produces, and which most men throw away. ","There is no greater calling than to serve your fellow men. There is no greater contribution than to help the weak. There is no greater satisfaction than to have done it well. ","The morality of compromise sounds contradictory. Compromise is usually a sign of weakness, or an admission of defeat. Strong men dont compromise, it is said, and principles should never be compromised. ","Formerly, when religion was strong and science weak, men mistook magic for medicine; now, when science is strong and religion weak, men mistake medicine for magic. ","To say that a work of art is good, but incomprehensible to the majority of men, is the same as saying of some kind of food that it is very good but that most people cant eat it. ","Either war is obsolete, or men are. ","We believe that if men have the talent to invent new machines that put men out of work, they have the talent to put those men back to work. ","There is a blessed necessity by which the interest of men is always driving them to the right; and, again, making all crime mean and ugly. ","You have to be very fond of men. Very, very fond. You have to be very fond of them to love them. Otherwise theyre simply unbearable. ","Perfect friendship is the friendship of men who are good, and alike in excellence; for these wish well alike to each other qua good, and they are good in themselves. ","It is a melancholy truth that even great men have their poor relations. ","All men are tempted. There is no man that lives that cant be broken down, provided it is the right temptation, put in the right spot. ","A wise man should so write (though in words understood by all men) that wise men only should be able to commend him. ","Men must live and create. Live to the point of tears. ","In the long run, men hit only what they aim at. Therefore, they had better aim at something high. ","Civilized society is perpetually menaced with disintegration through this primary hostility of men towards one another. ","Whenever men take the law into their own hands, the loser is the law. And when the law loses, freedom languishes. ","The skilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the covetous man, and the stupid man. ","Within the hearts men, loyalty and consideration are esteemed greater than success. ","Mens vows are womens traitors! ","Decisiveness is a characteristic of high-performing men and women. Almost any decision is better than no decision at all. ","Many men have been capable of doing a wise thing, more a cunning thing, but very few a generous thing. ","Men should pledge themselves to nothing; for reflection makes a liar of their resolution. ","There are people who want to make mens lives more difficult for no other reason than the chance it provides them afterwards to offer their prescription for alleviating life; their Christianity, for instance. ","One hundred religious persons knit into a unity by careful organizations do not constitute a church any more than eleven dead men make a football team. The first requisite is life, always. ","All men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree. ","It is from a weakness and smallness of mind that men are opinionated; and we are very loath to believe what we are not able to comprehend. ","The only really happy folk are married women and single men. ","I heard the old, old, men say all thats beautiful drifts away, like the waters. ","Every actual State is corrupt. Good men must not obey laws too well. ","Revolutions are brought about by men, by men who think as men of action and act as men of thought. ","All men are liable to error; and most men are, in many points, by passion or interest, under temptation to it. ","Being the boss anywhere is lonely. Being a female boss in a world of mostly men is especially so. ","It is not materialism that is the chief curse of the world, as pastors teach, but idealism. Men get into trouble by taking their visions and hallucinations too seriously. ","From the naturalistic point of view, all men are equal. There are only two exceptions to this rule of naturalistic equality: geniuses and idiots. ","There can be no equality or opportunity if men and women and children be not shielded in their lives from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which they cannot alter, control, or singly cope with. ","I never yet feared those men who set a place apart in the middle of their cities where they gather to cheat one another and swear oaths which they break. ","The tragedy of life and of the world is not that men do not know God; the tragedy is that, knowing Him, they still insist on going their own way. ","Nothing in the affairs of men is worthy of great anxiety. ","Daddy was real gentle with kids. Thats why I expected so much out of marriage, figuring that all men should be steady and pleasant. ","If we became students of Malcolm X, we would not have young black men out there killing each other like theyre killing each other now. Young black men would not be impregnating young black women at the rate going on now. Wed not have the drugs we have now, or the alcoholism. ","What we call Mans power over Nature turns out to be a power exercised by some men over other men with Nature as its instrument. ","Give to everyone who begs from you; and of him who takes away your goods do not ask them again. And as you wish that men would do to you, do so to them. ","I gave my beauty and my youth to men. I am going to give my wisdom and experience to animals. ","Real men are sadly lacking in this world, for when they are put to the test they prove worthless. ","We need men with moral courage to speak and write their real thoughts, and to stand by their convictions, even to the very death. ","But men are so full of greed today, theyll sell anything for a little piece of money. ","As we look forward to freedom, the shining city on the hill and the best days of America lying ahead, it is the men and women in uniform who protect, defend and make us proud to whom we should look and give thanks every night. ","Memorial Day this year is especially important as we are reminded almost daily of the great sacrifices that the men and women of the Armed Services make to defend our way of life. ","From too much love of living, From hope and fear set free, We thank with brief thanksgiving Whatever gods may be That no life lives for ever; That dead men rise up never; That even the weariest river Winds somewhere safe to sea. ","Resolved, that the women of this nation in 1876, have greater cause for discontent, rebellion and revolution than the men of 1776. ","Ive gone for each type: the rough guy; the nerdy, sweet, lovable guy; and the slick guy. I dont really have a type. Men in general are a good thing. ","To send light into the darkness of mens hearts - such is the duty of the artist. ","Advertising is a business of words, but advertising agencies are infested with men and women who cannot write. They cannot write advertisements, and they cannot write plans. They are helpless as deaf mutes on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera. ","A dress makes no sense unless it inspires men to take it off of you. ","Speaking very generally, I find that women are spiritually, emotionally, and often physically stronger than men. ","Men do change, and change comes like a little wind that ruffles the curtains at dawn, and it comes like the stealthy perfume of wildflowers hidden in the grass. ","Prosperous farmers mean more employment, more prosperity for the workers and the business men of every industrial area in the whole country. ","No man has any natural authority over his fellow men. ","Woman is the dominant sex. Men have to do all sorts of stuff to prove that they are worthy of womans attention. ","Im not denyin the women are foolish. God Almighty made em to match the men. ","We have wasted History like a bunch of drunks shooting dice back in the mens crapper of the local bar. ","Truth is the property of no individual but is the treasure of all men. ","Some men are alive simply because it is against the law to kill them. ","Dreaming men are haunted men. ","It is not these well-fed long-haired men that I fear, but the pale and the hungry-looking. ","Men are like the stars; some generate their own light while others reflect the brilliance they receive. ","It is only when men begin to worship that they begin to grow. ","Most men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it. ","Men do not learn much from the lessons of history and that is the most important of all the lessons of history. ","I have encountered riotous mobs and have been hung in effigy, but my motto is: Mens rights are nothing more. Womens rights are nothing less. ","A great many mens gratitude is nothing but a secret desire to hook in more valuable kindnesses hereafter. ","In reading the lives of great men, I found that the first victory they won was over themselves... self-discipline with all of them came first. ","Conservation is a state of harmony between men and land. ","How could man rejoice in victory and delight in the slaughter of men? ","The propensity to truck, barter and exchange one thing for another is common to all men, and to be found in no other race of animals. ","The tragedy of modern war is that the young men die fighting each other - instead of their real enemies back home in the capitals. ","Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few men are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others. ","Men are more prone to cheating, definitely. ","It was the men I deceived the most that I loved the most. ","When men hear women want a commitment, they think it means commitment to a romantic relationship, but thats not it. Its a commitment to not floating around anymore. I want a guy who is entrenched in his own life. Entrenched is awesome. ","The world is divided into men who have wit and no religion and men who have religion and no wit. ","Men in general are quick to believe that which they wish to be true. ","Men often pass from love to ambition, but they seldom come back again from ambition to love. ","Doing nothing is happiness for children and misery for old men. ","There are men so philosophical that they can see humor in their own toothaches. But there has never lived a man so philosophical that he could see the toothache in his own humor. ","Men can starve from a lack of self-realization as much as they can from a lack of bread. ","The breakdown of the black community, in order to maintain slavery, began with the breakdown of the black family. Men and women were not legally allowed to get married because you couldnt have that kind of love. It might get in the way of the economics of slavery. Your children could be taken from you and literally sold down the river. ","There have been many great men that have flattered the people who neer loved them. ","Men admire the man who can organize their wishes and thoughts in stone and wood and steel and brass. ","Only free men can negotiate; prisoners cannot enter into contracts. Your freedom and mine cannot be separated. ","Forgive, son; men are men; they needs must err. ","It is not true that suffering ennobles the character; happiness does that sometimes, but suffering for the most part, makes men petty and vindictive. ","Millions of men have lived to fight, build palaces and boundaries, shape destinies and societies; but the compelling force of all times has been the force of originality and creation profoundly affecting the roots of human spirit. ","It is an interesting question how far men would retain their relative rank if they were divested of their clothes. ","It is the dissimilarities and inequalities among men which give rise to the notion of honor; as such differences become less, it grows feeble; and when they disappear, it will vanish too. ","The principle goal of education in the schools should be creating men and women who are capable of doing new things, not simply repeating what other generations have done. ","Mark this well, you proud men of action! you are, after all, nothing but unconscious instruments of the men of thought. ","The latest research has revealed that women have a higher IQ than men. ","Men who are unhappy, like men who sleep badly, are always proud of the fact. ","Religions, which condemn the pleasures of sense, drive men to seek the pleasures of power. Throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic. ","These people are very unskilled in arms... with 50 men they could all be subjected and made to do all that one wished. ","Strong women only marry weak men. ","One of the things being in politics has taught me is that men are not a reasoned or reasonable sex. ","Under the pressure of the cares and sorrows of our mortal condition, men have at all times, and in all countries, called in some physical aid to their moral consolations - wine, beer, opium, brandy, or tobacco.

","Men acquire a particular quality by constantly acting in a particular way. ","Different men seek after happiness in different ways and by different means, and so make for themselves different modes of life and forms of government.

","There is no better proof of a mans being truly good than his desiring to be constantly under the observation of good men. ","There is nothing wrong with men possessing riches. The wrong comes when riches possess men. ","I think that the day youve figured out the differences between women and men is the day that youre no longer attracted to women. Its the difference that is so fantastic and frustrating and angering, and really sexy. ","America was established not to create wealth but to realize a vision, to realize an ideal - to discover and maintain liberty among men. ","Government is an evil; it is only the thoughtlessness and vices of men that make it a necessary evil. When all men are good and wise, government will of itself decay. ","Love, it has been said, flows downward. The love of parents for their children has always been far more powerful than that of children for their parents; and who among the sons of men ever loved God with a thousandth part of the love which God has manifested to us? ","In fact men will fight for a superstition quite as quickly as for a living truth - often more so, since a superstition is so intangible you cannot get at it to refute it, but truth is a point of view, and so is changeable. ","It is clearly better that property should be private, but the use of it common; and the special business of the legislator is to create in men this benevolent disposition. ","The fate of animals is of greater importance to me than the fear of appearing ridiculous; it is indissolubly connected with the fate of men. ","Its funny about men and women.

All I want is enough sleep for two normal men, enough whiskey for three, and enough women for four. ","When men speak ill of thee, live so as nobody may believe them. ","The happiness and misery of men depend no less on temper than fortune. ","Most people know no other way of judging mens worth but by the vogue they are in, or the fortunes they have met with.

","In our Country... one class of men makes war and leaves another to fight it out. ","When I look upon seamen, men of science and philosophers, man is the wisest of all beings; when I look upon priests and prophets nothing is as contemptible as man. ","The only good luck many great men ever had was being born with the ability and determination to overcome bad luck. ","Good men must not obey the laws too well. ","The reason why men do not obey us, is because they see the mud at the bottom of our eye. ","The only use of an obstacle is to be overcome. All that an obstacle does with brave men is, not to frighten them, but to challenge them. ","Mens magazines often feature pictures of naked ladies. Womens magazines also often feature pictures of naked ladies. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is hairy and lumpy and should not be seen by the light of day. ","Great indebtedness does not make men grateful, but vengeful; and if a little charity is not forgotten, it turns into a gnawing worm. ","When I was a boy, the Sioux owned the world. The sun rose and set on their land; they sent ten thousand men to battle. Where are the warriors today? Who slew them? Where are our lands? Who owns them? ","No great man lives in vain. The history of the world is but the biography of great men. ","Wives are young mens mistresses, companions for middle age, and old mens nurses. ","Men are not great or small because of their material possessions. They are great or small because of what they are. ","Though force can protect in emergency, only justice, fairness, consideration and cooperation can finally lead men to the dawn of eternal peace.

","A family is a unit composed not only of children but of men, women, an occasional animal, and the common cold. ","All soldiers who serve their country and put their lives at risk need to know that if something happens to them, their families will be well taken care of. Thats the bond we have with our military men and women and their families. ","Until the men of action clear out the talkers we who have social consciences are at the mercy of those who have none. ","I suppose when they reach a certain age some men are afraid to grow up. It seems the older the men get, the younger their new wives get. ","Although I do wrong, I do not the wrongs that I am charged with doing; the wrong that I do is through the frailty of human nature, like other men. No man lives without fault. ","Im done with men... Im going to be alone. I have no luck with relationships. I dont think Im made for marriage. ","Most of us women like men, you know; its just that we find them a constant disappointment. ","All men are frauds. The only difference between them is that some admit it. I myself deny it. ","It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men to express theirs. ","Most men are very attached to the idea of being male, and usually experience a lot of fear and insecurity around the idea of being a man. Most women are very identified with their gender, and also experience a tremendous amount of fear and insecurity. ","Men shut their doors against a setting sun. ","Observe all men, thyself most. ","Change is certain. Peace is followed by disturbances; departure of evil men by their return. Such recurrences should not constitute occasions for sadness but realities for awareness, so that one may be happy in the interim. ","False happiness renders men stern and proud, and that happiness is never communicated. True happiness renders them kind and sensible, and that happiness is always shared. ","I swear by that old expression, One monkey dont stop no show! The reality is, we still have some good men out there, and we should hail those men as the kings they are. ","For real change, we need feminine energy in the management of the world. We need a critical number of women in positions of power, and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men. ","If you would convince a man that he does wrong, do right. Men will believe what they see. ","The law will never make a man free; it is men who have got to make the law free. ","Nothing doth more hurt in a state than that cunning men pass for wise. ","What a curious phenomenon it is that you can get men to die for the liberty of the world who will not make the little sacrifice that is needed to free themselves from their own individual bondage. ","Violent men have not been known in history to die to a man. They die up to a point. ","Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir mens blood. ","All men should strive to learn before they die, what they are running from, and to, and why. ","All sorts of computer errors are now turning up. Youd be surprised to know the number of doctors who claim they are treating pregnant men. ","If men and women are to understand each other, to enter into each others nature with mutual sympathy, and to become capable of genuine comradeship, the foundation must be laid in youth. ","I love being a woman and I was not one of these women who rose through professional life by wearing mens clothes or looking masculine. I loved wearing bright colors and being who I am. ","What is absurd and monstrous about war is that men who have no personal quarrel should be trained to murder one another in cold blood. ","If its natural to kill, how come men have to go into training to learn how? ","Regarding life, the wisest men of all ages have judged alike: it is worthless. ","Love is a force more formidable than any other. It is invisible - it cannot be seen or measured, yet it is powerful enough to transform you in a moment, and offer you more joy than any material possession could. ","Do all things with love. ","Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another. ","Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity. ","I was born with an enormous need for affection, and a terrible need to give it. ","A kiss makes the heart young again and wipes out the years. ","Absence diminishes mediocre passions and increases great ones, as the wind extinguishes candles and fans fires. ","At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. ","We love life, not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving. ","Love yourself first and everything else falls into line. You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world. ","Love is a better teacher than duty. ","Love is always bestowed as a gift - freely, willingly and without expectation. We dont love to be loved; we love to love. ","Love is like war: easy to begin but very hard to stop. ","Come live in my heart, and pay no rent. ","If you press me to say why I loved him, I can say no more than because he was he, and I was I. ","The hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread. ","What we have once enjoyed we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us. ","Love is life. And if you miss love, you miss life. ","The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. ","Faith makes all things possible... love makes all things easy. ","Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship - never. ","As soon go kindle fire with snow, as seek to quench the fire of love with words. ","The best proof of love is trust. ","A very small degree of hope is sufficient to cause the birth of love. ","Love isnt something you find. Love is something that finds you. ","I like not only to be loved, but also to be told I am loved. ","A part of kindness consists in loving people more than they deserve. ","Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit. ","Love can sometimes be magic. But magic can sometimes... just be an illusion. ","Love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place. ","We loved with a love that was more than love. ","Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can grow, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky. ","A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love. ","The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved; loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves. ","A loving heart is the truest wisdom. ","All my life, my heart has yearned for a thing I cannot name. ","To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance. ","Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired. ","First love is only a little foolishness and a lot of curiosity. ","I can live without money, but I cannot live without love. ","Love is the flower youve got to let grow. ","True love is like ghosts, which everyone talks about and few have seen. ","Love is a game that two can play and both win. ","We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love. ","Love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own. ","Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs. ","Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. ","The way to love anything is to realize that it may be lost. ","All love shifts and changes. I dont know if you can be wholeheartedly in love all the time. ","Everything is clearer when youre in love. ","The art of love is largely the art of persistence. ","Who, being loved, is poor? ","The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden, a dim twilight, and a fountain singing to it. You and you alone make me feel that I am alive. Other men it is said have seen angels, but I have seen thee and thou art enough. ","The one thing we can never get enough of is love. And the one thing we never give enough is love. ","For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love. ","The giving of love is an education in itself. ","All mankind love a lover. ","Love is a friendship set to music.

","Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence. ","If you wish to be loved, show more of your faults than your virtues. ","There is no remedy for love but to love more. ","I was about half in love with her by the time we sat down. Thats the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty... you fall half in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are. ","It is sad not to love, but it is much sadder not to be able to love. ","Love does not dominate; it cultivates. ","You will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love. ","Love is the beauty of the soul. ","If you want to be loved, be lovable. ","If you would be loved, love, and be loveable. ","Before I met my husband, Id never fallen in love. Id stepped in it a few times. ","Love possesses not nor will it be possessed, for love is sufficient unto love.

","There is no disguise which can hide love for long where it exists, or simulate it where it does not. ","A kiss is a rosy dot over the i of loving. ","Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other. ","Looking back, I have this to regret, that too often when I loved, I did not say so.

","Love is the only reality and it is not a mere sentiment. It is the ultimate truth that lies at the heart of creation. ","I believe in the compelling power of love. I do not understand it. I believe it to be the most fragrant blossom of all this thorny existence. ","Sometimes its a form of love just to talk to somebody that you have nothing in common with and still be fascinated by their presence. ","People think love is an emotion. Love is good sense. ","The sweetest of all sounds is that of the voice of the woman we love. ","Love knows not distance; it hath no continent; its eyes are for the stars. ","There is a woman at the begining of all great things. ","Love is the greatest refreshment in life. ","There is only one kind of love, but there are a thousand imitations.

","Love is all we have, the only way that each can help the other. ","If you could only love enough, you could be the most powerful person in the world. ","Your words are my food, your breath my wine. You are everything to me. ","To witness two lovers is a spectacle for the gods. ","Love is only a dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the species. ","The way to know life is to love many things. ","Love means to commit yourself without guarantee. ","Love takes up where knowledge leaves off. ","Love in its essence is spiritual fire. ","Follow love and it will flee, flee love and it will follow thee. ","There is no surprise more magical than the surprise of being loved: It is Gods finger on mans shoulder. ","Down on your knees, and thank heaven, fasting, for a good mans love. ","Fortune and love favor the brave. ","Love is what youve been through with somebody. ","Each moment of a happy lovers hour is worth an age of dull and common life. ","Love is suffering. One side always loves more. ","Love looks through a telescope; envy, through a microscope. ","Love is always being given where it is not required. ","There are never enough I Love Yous. ","Friendship is Love without his wings! ","Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. ","We are all born for love. It is the principle of existence, and its only end. ","Love is the poetry of the senses. ","Come live with me and be my love, And we will all the pleasures prove, That valleys, groves, hills, and fields, Woods, or steepy mountain yields. ","Love means to love that which is unlovable; or it is no virtue at all. ","We may give without loving, but we cannot love without giving. ","There is always something left to love. And if you aint learned that, you aint learned nothing. ","The fact is that love is of two kinds, one which commands, and one which obeys. The two are quite distinct, and the passion to which the one gives rise is not the passion of the other. ","People who throw kisses are hopelessly lazy. ","The truth is that there is only one terminal dignity - love. And the story of a love is not important - what is important is that one is capable of love. It is perhaps the only glimpse we are permitted of eternity. ","Love is the great miracle cure. Loving ourselves works miracles in our lives. ","For love is immortality. ","If you can learn to love yourself and all the flaws, you can love other people so much better. And that makes you so happy. ","Take away love and our earth is a tomb. ","In every living thing there is the desire for love. ","Love conquers all. ","If thou must love me, let it be for naught except for loves sake only. ","Sometimes its hard to be a woman giving all your love to just one man. ","Love is but the discovery of ourselves in others, and the delight in the recognition. ","Love is the power to see similarity in the dissimilar. ","To love abundantly is to live abundantly, and to love forever is to live forever. ","Say what you will, tis better to be left than never to have been loved. ","Love is that splendid triggering of human vitality the supreme activity which nature affords anyone for going out of himself toward someone else. ","The first magic of love is our ignorance that it can ever end. ","To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides. ","Love is the word used to label the sexual excitement of the young, the habituation of the middle-aged, and the mutual dependence of the old. ","Love is the child of illusion and the parent of disillusion. ","The quarrels of lovers are the renewal of love. ","I dont know that love changes. People change. Circumstances change. ","When you love a man, he becomes more than a body. His physical limbs expand, and his outline recedes, vanishes. He is rich and sweet and right. He is part of the world, the atmosphere, the blue sky and the blue water. ","Do you have to have a reason for loving? ","Loves greatest gift is its ability to make everything it touches sacred. ","Woe to the man whose heart has not learned while young to hope, to love - and to put its trust in life. ","What the world really needs is more love and less paper work. ","Sympathy constitutes friendship; but in love there is a sort of antipathy, or opposing passion. Each strives to be the other, and both together make up one whole. ","No one has ever loved anyone the way everyone wants to be loved. ","Let no one who loves be unhappy, even love unreturned has its rainbow. ","Love you will find only where you may show yourself weak without provoking strength. ","As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. ","When you love someone all your saved up wishes start coming out. ","He who loves, flies, runs, and rejoices; he is free and nothing holds him back. ","Love is the only gold. ","It is easier to love humanity as a whole than to love ones neighbor. ","Love is a springtime plant that perfumes everything with its hope, even the ruins to which it clings. ","Though lovers be lost love shall not. ","Love means not ever having to say youre sorry. ","O, thou art fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of a thousand stars. ","Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold. ","With our love, we could save the world. ","When youre in love you never really know whether your elation comes from the qualities of the one you love, or if it attributes them to her; whether the light which surrounds her like a halo comes from you, from her, or from the meeting of your sparks. ","Love is a mutual self-giving which ends in self-recovery. ","There is no limit to the power of loving. ","There is more pleasure in loving than in being beloved. ","Love is when he gives you a piece of your soul, that you never knew was missing. ","To love for the sake of being loved is human, but to love for the sake of loving is angelic. ","Love is like a faucet, it turns off and on. ","Who so loves believes the impossible. ","When love is at its best, one loves so much that he cannot forget. ","Who loves, raves. ","Love is metaphysical gravity. ","True love is quiescent, except in the nascent moments of true humility. ","Stand by your man. Give him two arms to cling to and something warm to come to. ","More than kisses, letters mingle souls. ","To good and true love fear is forever affixed. ","Only love interests me, and I am only in contact with things that revolve around love. ","It is very easy to love alone. ","You dont want to love - your eternal and abnormal craving is to be loved. You arent positive, youre negative. You absorb, absorb, as if you must fill yourself up with love, because youve got a shortage somewhere. ","Pains of love be sweeter far than all other pleasures are. ","There is room in the smallest cottage for a happy loving pair. ","Ultimately love is everything. ","Only divine love bestows the keys of knowledge. ","You dont have to go looking for love when its where you come from. ","The richest love is that which submits to the arbitration of time. ","What is love? It is the morning and the evening star. ","We can only learn to love by loving. ","Love ceases to be a pleasure when it ceases to be a secret. ","We perceive when love begins and when it declines by our embarrassment when alone together. ","All love is vanquished by a succeeding love. ","We love but once, for once only are we perfectly equipped for loving. ","We are most alive when were in love. ","In love there are two things - bodies and words. ","Love is an energy which exists of itself. It is its own value. ","Who ever loved that loved not at first sight? ","Love is loves reward. ","But loves a malady without a cure. ","Who would give a law to lovers? Love is unto itself a higher law. ","The cure for all the ills and wrongs, the cares, the sorrows, and the crimes of humanity, all lie in the one word love. It is the divine vitality that everywhere produces and restores life. ","When we lose one we love, our bitterest tears are called forth by the memory of hours when we loved not enough. ","Love is much nicer to be in than an automobile accident, a tight girdle, a higher tax bracket or a holding pattern over Philadelphia. ","I long for the raised voice, the howl of rage or love. ","Love is blind. ","Is it not by love alone that we succeed in penetrating to the very essence of being? ","Love is a hole in the heart. ","Oh, love will make a dog howl in rhyme. ","In our life there is a single color, as on an artists palette, which provides the meaning of life and art. It is the color of love. ","Love is the magician that pulls man out of his own hat. ","To enlarge or illustrate this power and effect of love is to set a candle in the sun. ","One must not trifle with love. ","All love is lost but upon God alone. ","Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. ","Life is a song - sing it. Life is a game - play it. Life is a challenge - meet it. Life is a dream - realize it. Life is a sacrifice - offer it. Life is love - enjoy it. ","We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies. ","Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none. ","When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. ","Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life. ","Motherhood: All love begins and ends there. ","You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. ","A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person. ","Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. ","My great hope is to laugh as much as I cry; to get my work done and try to love somebody and have the courage to accept the love in return. ","To love beauty is to see light. ","It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages. ","Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them humanity cannot survive. ","I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. ","When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love. ","All major religious traditions carry basically the same message, that is love, compassion and forgiveness the important thing is they should be part of our daily lives. ","Dont aim for success if you want it; just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally. ","The love of family and the admiration of friends is much more important than wealth and privilege. ","Never forget the three powerful resources you always have available to you: love, prayer, and forgiveness. ","I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant. ","There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love. ","If music be the food of love, play on. ","Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love. ","Love begins by taking care of the closest ones - the ones at home. ","There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love. ","If you have only one smile in you give it to the people you love. ","Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into friend. ","Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule. ","It is easy to hate and it is difficult to love. This is how the whole scheme of things works. All good things are difficult to achieve; and bad things are very easy to get. ","Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope. ","I love people who make me laugh. I honestly think its the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. Its probably the most important thing in a person. ","If you love life, dont waste time, for time is what life is made up of. ","I love you when you bow in your mosque, kneel in your temple, pray in your church. For you and I are sons of one religion, and it is the spirit. ","All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesnt hurt. ","The most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother. ","Before marriage, a girl has to make love to a man to hold him. After marriage, she has to hold him to make love to him. ","I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death. ","It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think thats pretty important. ","At the center of non-violence stands the principle of love. ","Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness. ","Between men and women there is no friendship possible. There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship. ","Never trust anyone completely but God. Love people, but put your full trust only in God. ","I say what I want to say and do what I want to do. Theres no in between. People will either love you for it or hate you for it. ","A coward is incapable of exhibiting love; it is the prerogative of the brave. ","The foundation stones for a balanced success are honesty, character, integrity, faith, love and loyalty. ","I love being married. Its so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life. ","You cant blame gravity for falling in love. ","If you love someone, set them free. If they come back theyre yours; if they dont they never were. ","If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. And if they dont, they never were. ","Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude. ","Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies - or else? The chain reaction of evil - hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars - must be broken, or else we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation. ","You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection. ","People love chopping wood. In this activity one immediately sees results. ","It is not enough to say we must not wage war. It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it. ","You cant stop loving or wanting to love because when its right its the best thing in the world. When youre in a relationship and its good, even if nothing else in your life is right, you feel like your whole world is complete. ","If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it. ","Intense love does not measure, it just gives. ","Even the rich are hungry for love, for being cared for, for being wanted, for having someone to call their own. ","Love is a fruit in season at all times, and within reach of every hand. ","The first duty of love is to listen. ","I love mirrors. They let one pass through the surface of things. ","Mama was my greatest teacher, a teacher of compassion, love and fearlessness. If love is sweet as a flower, then my mother is that sweet flower of love. ","Let us more and more insist on raising funds of love, of kindness, of understanding, of peace. Money will come if we seek first the Kingdom of God - the rest will be given. ","Let us not be satisfied with just giving money. Money is not enough, money can be got, but they need your hearts to love them. So, spread your love everywhere you go. ","Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love. ","Love is friendship that has caught fire. It is quiet understanding, mutual confidence, sharing and forgiving. It is loyalty through good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses. ","The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides. ","And ever has it been known that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation. ","Men always want to be a womans first love - women like to be a mans last romance. ","Love of beauty is taste. The creation of beauty is art. ","Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own... Jealousy is a disease, love is a healthy condition. The immature mind often mistakes one for the other, or assumes that the greater the love, the greater the jealousy. ","We are not the same persons this year as last; nor are those we love. It is a happy chance if we, changing, continue to love a changed person. ","Love is like a beautiful flower which I may not touch, but whose fragrance makes the garden a place of delight just the same. ","I know of only one duty, and that is to love. ","Absence from those we love is self from self - a deadly banishment. ","The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves, and not to twist them to fit our own image. Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them. ","I honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate. ","If we lose love and self respect for each other, this is how we finally die. ","But let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. ","The course of true love never did run smooth. ","The greatest gift that you can give to others is the gift of unconditional love and acceptance. ","I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when Im awake, you know? ","Be Impeccable With Your Word. Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love. ","One should always be in love. That is the reason one should never marry. ","Anyway, no drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental ills of society. If were looking for the source of our troubles, we shouldnt test people for drugs, we should test them for stupidity, ignorance, greed and love of power. ","A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her. ","If we listened to our intellect, wed never have a love affair. Wed never have a friendship. Wed never go into business, because wed be cynical. Well, thats nonsense. Youve got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down. ","If someone thinks that love and peace is a cliche that must have been left behind in the Sixties, thats his problem. Love and peace are eternal. ","Many people mistake our work for our vocation. Our vocation is the love of Jesus. ","Forgiveness is the final form of love. ","The things that will destroy America are prosperity-at-any-price, peace-at-any-price, safety-first instead of duty-first, the love of soft living, and the get-rich-quick theory of life. ","I see when men love women. They give them but a little of their lives. But women when they love give everything. ","Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls. ","Rare as is true love, true friendship is rarer. ","Love is the ability and willingness to allow those that you care for to be what they choose for themselves without any insistence that they satisfy you. ","Weve got this gift of love, but love is like a precious plant. You cant just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think its going to get on by itself. Youve got to keep watering it. Youve got to really look after it and nurture it. ","There is always the danger that we may just do the work for the sake of the work. This is where the respect and the love and the devotion come in - that we do it to God, to Christ, and thats why we try to do it as beautifully as possible. ","Falling in love and having a relationship are two different things. ","God proved His love on the Cross. When Christ hung, and bled, and died, it was God saying to the world, I love you. ","Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart. ","Love one another and help others to rise to the higher levels, simply by pouring out love. Love is infectious and the greatest healing energy. ","Where we love is home - home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts. ","I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by. ","As selfishness and complaint pervert the mind, so love with its joy clears and sharpens the vision. ","Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction. ","When you fish for love, bait with your heart, not your brain. ","There are four questions of value in life... What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for? The answer to each is the same. Only love. ","The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends. ","Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy. ","Love is like a virus. It can happen to anybody at any time. ","Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you havent found it yet, keep looking. Dont settle. As with all matters of the heart, youll know when you find it. ","We never know the love of a parent till we become parents ourselves. ","Love is a serious mental disease. ","I try to give to the poor people for love what the rich could get for money. No, I wouldnt touch a leper for a thousand pounds; yet I willingly cure him for the love of God. ","Love to faults is always blind, always is to joy inclined. Lawless, winged, and unconfined, and breaks all chains from every mind. ","Trust is to human relationships what faith is to gospel living. It is the beginning place, the foundation upon which more can be built. Where trust is, love can flourish. ","Christmas, my child, is love in action. Every time we love, every time we give, its Christmas. ","Three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for. ","Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. ","Power is of two kinds. One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love. Power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent then the one derived from fear of punishment. ","I love those who yearn for the impossible. ","Our life of poverty is as necessary as the work itself. Only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love God better because of them. ","Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... its your responsibility to love it, or change it. ","It has always seemed strange to me... the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest, are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second. ","Knowledge is love and light and vision. ","All, everything that I understand, I understand only because I love. ","I have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate - its apathy. Its not giving a damn. ","Respect is what we owe; love, what we give. ","I guess I have always been deeply terrified to really be someones wife since I know from life one cannot love another, ever, really. ","To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless. ","I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death. ","We cant command our love, but we can our actions. ","If you want to be successful, its just this simple. Know what you are doing. Love what you are doing. And believe in what you are doing. ","Love sought is good, but given unsought, is better. ","I love life because what more is there? ","Once in his life, every man is entitled to fall madly in love with a gorgeous redhead. ","Who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make love known? ","But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. ","Justice that love gives is a surrender, justice that law gives is a punishment. ","Politics is such a torment that I advise everyone I love not to mix with it. ","Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country. ","Love one another, but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. ","Love is blind; friendship closes its eyes. ","This is one of the miracles of love: It gives a power of seeing through its own enchantments and yet not being disenchanted. ","Speak low, if you speak love. ","What light is to the eyes - what air is to the lungs - what love is to the heart, liberty is to the soul of man. ","What does love look like? It has the hands to help others. It has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy. It has eyes to see misery and want. It has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men. That is what love looks like. ","Love. Fall in love and stay in love. Write only what you love, and love what you write. The key word is love. You have to get up in the morning and write something you love, something to live for. ","Love cannot save you from your own fate. ","Love is too young to know what conscience is. ","Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our gigantic intellects. ","Yesterday we obeyed kings and bent our necks before emperors. But today we kneel only to truth, follow only beauty, and obey only love. ","Hatred is blind, as well as love. ","Where love is, there God is also. ","The best smell in the world is that man that you love. ","When a man has once loved a woman he will do anything for her except continue to love her. ","Alcohol may be mans worst enemy, but the bible says love your enemy. ","Love is not love that alters when it alteration finds. ","No matter how dark the moment, love and hope are always possible. ","All you need is love. ","The sadness of the womens movement is that they dont allow the necessity of love. See, I dont personally trust any revolution where love is not allowed. ","Love will find a way through paths where wolves fear to prey. ","Show me your hands. Do they have scars from giving? Show me your feet. Are they wounded in service? Show me your heart. Have you left a place for divine love? ","There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. ","Mans nature is not essentially evil. Brute nature has been know to yield to the influence of love. You must never despair of human nature. ","The love of heaven makes one heavenly. ","A friendship that like love is warm; A love like friendship, steady. ","They do not love that do not show their love. ","The mother-child relationship is paradoxical and, in a sense, tragic. It requires the most intense love on the mothers side, yet this very love must help the child grow away from the mother, and to become fully independent. ","There is no love without forgiveness, and there is no forgiveness without love. ","Those whom the gods love grow young. ","Im an introvert... I love being by myself, love being outdoors, love taking a long walk with my dogs and looking at the trees, flowers, the sky. ","Love is the answer, and you know that for sure; Love is a flower, youve got to let it grow. ","The game of basketball has been everything to me. My place of refuge, place Ive always gone where I needed comfort and peace. Its been the site of intense pain and the most intense feelings of joy and satisfaction. Its a relationship that has evolved over time, given me the greatest respect and love for the game. ","Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we dont know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings. ","Is it not enough to know the evil to shun it? If not, we should be sincere enough to admit that we love evil too well to give it up. ","Love is never lost. If not reciprocated, it will flow back and soften and purify the heart. ","If we love our country, we should also love our countrymen. ","Love and doubt have never been on speaking terms. ","Love is trembling happiness. ","The story of life is quicker then the blink of an eye, the story of love is hello, goodbye. ","Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation. ","True love doesnt happen right away; its an ever-growing process. It develops after youve gone through many ups and downs, when youve suffered together, cried together, laughed together. ","I love argument, I love debate. I dont expect anyone just to sit there and agree with me, thats not their job. ","Presents dont really mean much to me. I dont want to sound mawkish, but - it was the realization that I have a great many people in my life who really love me, and who I really love. ","Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of. ","I swear, by my life and my love of it, that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine. ","One advantage of marriage is that, when you fall out of love with him or he falls out of love with you, it keeps you together until you fall in again. ","Do not hire a man who does your work for money, but him who does it for love of it. ","Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age. ","I wish people would love everybody else the way they love me. It would be a better world. ","Even when Im old and grey, I wont be able to play it, but Ill still love the game. ","If you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work. ","A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself. ","I do all the evil I can before I learn to shun it? Is it not enough to know the evil to shun it? If not, we should be sincere enough to admit that we love evil too well to give it up. ","Im not claiming divinity. Ive never claimed purity of soul. Ive never claimed to have the answers to life. I only put out songs and answer questions as honestly as I can... But I still believe in peace, love and understanding. ","Where theres marriage without love, there will be love without marriage. ","He who falls in love with himself will have no rivals. ","Ill love you, dear, Ill love you till China and Africa meet and the river jumps over the mountain and the salmon sing in the street. ","Love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness. ","I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude. ","Money cant buy love, but it improves your bargaining position. ","Coming generations will learn equality from poverty, and love from woes. ","Flatter me, and I may not believe you. Criticize me, and I may not like you. Ignore me, and I may not forgive you. Encourage me, and I will not forget you. Love me and I may be forced to love you. ","There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness. ","Doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life. ","Mothers love is peace. It need not be acquired, it need not be deserved. ","Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air, is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies. ","I am good, but not an angel. I do sin, but I am not the devil. I am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love. ","Today I love myself as I love my god: who could charge me with a sin today? I know only sins against my god; but who knows my god? ","Dont do anything by half. If you love someone, love them with all your soul. When you go to work, work your ass off. When you hate someone, hate them until it hurts. ","The greatest healing therapy is friendship and love. ","Men love to wonder, and that is the seed of science. ","I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts.

","Love, like a chicken salad or restaurant hash, must be taken with blind faith or it loses its flavor. ","To be in love is merely to be in a state of perceptual anesthesia - to mistake an ordinary young woman for a goddess. ","Music is what I breath, what I love to do. It keeps me alive. ","Love is moral even without legal marriage, but marriage is immoral without love. ","Romantic love is mental illness. But its a pleasurable one. Its a drug. It distorts reality, and thats the point of it. It would be impossible to fall in love with someone that you really saw. ","No woman ever hates a man for being in love with her, but many a woman hate a man for being a friend to her. ","You know, all that really matters is that the people you love are happy and healthy. Everything else is just sprinkles on the sundae. ","If there is such a thing as a good marriage, it is because it resembles friendship rather than love. ","The essential elements of giving are power and love - activity and affection - and the consciousness of the race testifies that in the high and appropriate exercise of these is a blessedness greater than any other. ","You dont walk away if you love someone. You help the person. ","First and last, what is demanded of genius is love of truth. ","The Bee Gees who are brilliant, I just love great music. ","Smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women. ","Love seeketh not itself to please, nor for itself hath any care, but for another gives its ease, and builds a Heaven in Hells despair. ","I dont know if I believe in love at first sight, but of course I believe in two people having chemistry right away. A girl should be really easy to talk to. When I lose track of time because weve been talking, I think thats really fun. ","I feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people. ","I have a love interest in every one of my films: a gun. ","Sex is a part of love. You shouldnt go around doing it unless you are in love. ","You can never control who you fall in love with, even when youre in the most sad, confused time of your life. You dont fall in love with people because theyre fun. It just happens. ","Love can do much, but duty more. ","Love him and let him love you. Do you think anything else under heaven really matters? ","Love always involves responsibility, and love always involves sacrifice. And we do not really love Christ unless we are prepared to face His task and to take up His Cross. ","I love my family very much. I wish I could see them a little more often than I do. But we understand because were a show business family and we all work. ","Listen to your inner-voice: Surround yourself with loving, nurturing people. Fall in love with your art and find yourself. Music is the great communicator. ","A man always remembers his first love with special tenderness, but after that he begins to bunch them. ","Romantic love is an illusion. Most of us discover this truth at the end of a love affair or else when the sweet emotions of love lead us into marriage and then turn down their flames.

For even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. ","What I am is how I came out. No ones perfect and you just have to accept your flaws and learn to love yourself. ","So, fall asleep love, loved by me... for I know love, I am loved by thee.

I need my phone so I can keep in contact with them at all times. ","Adultery is the application of democracy to love. ","I love power. But it is as an artist that I love it. I love it as a musician loves his violin, to draw out its sounds and chords and harmonies. ","Ive only been in love with a beer bottle and a mirror. ","The secret of a happy marriage is finding the right person. You know theyre right if you love to be with them all the time. ","A poet is, before anything else, a person who is passionately in love with language. ","Love and work... work and love, thats all there is. ","Marriage is not a noun; its a verb.

","There is a courtesy of the heart; it is allied to love. From its springs the purest courtesy in the outward behavior. ","Love has features which pierce all hearts, he wears a bandage which conceals the faults of those beloved. He has wings, he comes quickly and flies away the same. ","It is one of the severest tests of friendship to tell your friend his faults. So to love a man that you cannot bear to see a stain upon him, and to speak painful truth through loving words, that is friendship. ","Prayer does not use up artificial energy, doesnt burn up any fossil fuel, doesnt pollute. Neither does song, neither does love, neither does the dance. ","Friendship at first sight, like love at first sight, is said to be the only truth. ","Truth is so obscure in these times, and falsehood so established, that, unless we love the truth, we cannot know it. ","Where love is concerned, too much is not even enough. ","Im a romantic, and we romantics are more sensitive to the way people feel. We love more, and we hurt more. When were hurt, we hurt for a long time. ","You should hurry up and acquire the cigar habit. Its one of the major happinesses. And so much more lasting than love, so much less costly in emotional wear and tear. ","What Ive enjoyed most, though, is meeting people who have a real interest in food and sharing ideas with them. Good food is a global thing and I find that there is always something new and amazing to learn - I love it! ","The first symptom of love in a young man is timidity; in a girl boldness. ","Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain it. ","I might get drunk one day and fall in love or fall over a hooker outside, and I would have consummated a relationship that I couldnt necessarily believe in. ","My mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all - the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would be, and much less about what we would do.

","Life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind. ","It sounds like a cliche but I also learnt that youre not going to fall for the right person until you really love yourself and feel good about how you are. ","Unless you love someone, nothing else makes any sense. ","All happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love.

","The hardest people to reach with the love of God are not the bad people. They know they are bad. They have no defense. The hardest ones to win for God are the self-righteous people.

Sometimes Ill watch TV and go into a lotion trance for an hour. I try to find brands that dont taste bad in case anyone wants to taste me. ","A ladys imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment. ","We dont believe in rheumatism and true love until after the first attack. ","Give a little love to a child, and you get a great deal back. ","This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life. Finally, to take a step without feet. ","If one is desperate for love, I suggest looking at ones friends and family and see if love is all around. If not, get a new set of friends, a new family. ","Falling out of love is chiefly a matter of forgetting how charming someone is. ","A flower falls, even though we love it; and a weed grows, even though we do not love it. ","Whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country, it is a sign that he expects to be paid for it. ","Our dilemma is that we hate change and love it at the same time; what we really want is for things to remain the same but get better. ","When you are older you will understand how precious little things, seemingly of no value in themselves, can be loved and prized above all price when they convey the love and thoughtfulness of a good heart. ","And a special thank you to the citizens of Massachusetts: You are paying all the taxes, creating all the jobs, raising all the children. This government is yours. Thank you for letting me serve you. I love this job. ","About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some wont like you at all. ","You dont have to love them. You just have to respect their rights. ","Love is anterior to life, posterior to death, initial of creation, and the exponent of breath. ","There isnt any formula or method. You learn to love by loving - by paying attention and doing what one thereby discovers has to be done. ","This love is silent. ","When people are lame, they love to blame. ","Im getting a wrinkle above my eyebrow because I just cant stop lifting it, and I love that you know. ","Black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love.

","Love never dies of starvation, but often of indigestion. ","People everywhere love Windows. ","Love is union with somebody, or something, outside oneself, under the condition of retaining the separateness and integrity of ones own self. ","Just dont give up trying to do what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I dont think you can go wrong. ","True love cannot be found where it does not exist, nor can it be denied where it does. ","If you dont love me, it does not matter, anyway I can love for both of us. ","The highest patriotism is not a blind acceptance of official policy, but a love of ones country deep enough to call her to a higher plain. ","To fall in love is easy, even to remain in it is not difficult; our human loneliness is cause enough. But it is a hard quest worth making to find a comrade through whose steady presence one becomes steadily the person one desires to be. ","Love is an attempt at penetrating another being, but it can only succeed if the surrender is mutual. ","There is a fountain of youth: it is your mind, your talents, the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of people you love. When you learn to tap this source, you will truly have defeated age. ","Act happy, feel happy, be happy, without a reason in the world. Then you can love, and do what you will. ","So long as we love, we serve; so long as we are loved by others, I should say that we are almost indispensable; and no man is useless while he has a friend. ","Love is easy, and I love writing. You cant resist love. You get an idea, someone says something, and youre in love. ","If youre lucky enough to have a pretty girl love you and share herself and sleep with you, make that your secret.

","At best the family teaches the finest things human beings can learn from one another generosity and love. But it is also, all too often, where we learn nasty things like hate, rage and shame. ","All married couples should learn the art of battle as they should learn the art of making love. Good battle is objective and honest - never vicious or cruel. Good battle is healthy and constructive, and brings to a marriage the principles of equal partnership. ","A man without ambition is dead. A man with ambition but no love is dead. A man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive. ","To live in this world, you must be able to do three things: to love what is mortal; to hold it against your bones knowing your own life depends on it; and, when the time comes to let it go, to let it go. ","If I think more about death than some other people, it is probably because I love life more than they do. ","If thou desire the love of God and man, be humble, for the proud heart, as it loves none but itself, is beloved of none but itself.

","The Bible tells us to love our neighbors, and also to love our enemies; probably because generally they are the same people. ","Love is a portion of the soul itself, and it is of the same nature as the celestial breathing of the atmosphere of paradise. ","If one of two lovers is loyal, and the other jealous and false, how may their friendship last, for Love is slain! ","Without contraries is no progression. Attraction and repulsion, reason and energy, love and hate, are necessary to human existence. ","Why love if losing hurts so much? I have no answers anymore; only the life I have lived. The pain now is part of the happiness then. ","There is nothing I love as much as a good fight. ","I just want to do what I do best, and thats fight. I love it. ","Love is the answer to everything. Its the only reason to do anything. If you dont write stories you love, youll never make it. If you dont write stories that other people love, youll never make it. ","I usually get myself into situations that cause sparks. I mean Im a girl that likes the storms. I love feeling alive, I love walking out in the cold in my bare feet and feeling the ice on my toes.

And - and we have bus loads of kids, who dont get to see those things. They come up sick children, and enjoy it. ","Chemistry can be a good and bad thing. Chemistry is good when you make love with it. Chemistry is bad when you make crack with it.

","It is not in the power of even the most crafty dissimulation to conceal love long, where it really is, nor to counterfeit it long where it is not. ","If Jesus was here, do you think Jesus would show me any love? Do you think Jesus would love me? ","It is a great consolation for me to remember that the Lord, to whom I had drawn near in humble and child-like faith, has suffered and died for me, and that He will look on me in love and compassion. ","Love is the river of life in the world. ","Love is friendship set on fire. ","Mothers are the people who love us for no good reason. And those of us who are mothers know its the most exquisite love of all. ","You are precisely as big as what you love and precisely as small as what you allow to annoy you. ","Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age. ","Nobody loves a woman because she is handsome or ugly, stupid or intelligent. We love because we love. ","My trust in a higher power that wants me to survive and have love in my life, is what keeps me moving forward. ","The only thing we never get enough of is love; and the only thing we never give enough of is love.

","Everyone can relate to love, hurt, pain, learning how to forgive, needing to get over, needing the power of God in their life. ","Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. ","When I sing, I feel like when youre first in love. Its more than sex. Its that point two people can get to they call love, when you really touch someone for the first time, but its gigantic, multiplied by the whole audience. I feel chills. ","The love of learning, the sequestered nooks, And all the sweet serenity of books. ","A lot of times black folks look for love in all the wrong places. Youre always looking for somebody to love you, be accepted, and theres the insecurities that are even transmitted through rap. Everyone is trying to aim to please too much. ","Love does not alter the beloved, it alters itself. ","Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius. ","If were destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff, theres got to be a very powerful energy to fight that. I think we need more love in the world. We need more kindness, more compassion, more joy, more laughter. I definitely want to contribute to that. ","We love to expect, and when expectation is either disappointed or gratified, we want to be again expecting. ","When youre taught to love everyone, to love your enemies, then what value does that place on love? ","Men often pass from love to ambition, but they seldom come back again from ambition to love. ","If you cannot inspire a woman with love of you, fill her above the brim with love of herself; all that runs over will be yours. ","I understand now that the vulnerability Ive always felt is the greatest strength a person can have. You cant experience life without feeling life. What Ive learned is that being vulnerable to somebody you love is not a weakness, its a strength. ","Wine comes in at the mouth And love comes in at the eye; Thats all we shall know for truth Before we grow old and die. ","If a man is truly in love, the most beautiful woman in the world couldnt take him away. Maybe for a few days, but not forever. ","The main facts in human life are five: birth, food, sleep, love and death. ","The love that lasts longest is the love that is never returned. ","Men shrink less from offending one who inspires love than one who inspires fear. ","Computers are magnificent tools for the realization of our dreams, but no machine can replace the human spark of spirit, compassion, love, and understanding. ","This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love: the more they give, the more they possess. ","Tell the truth. Sing with passion. Work with laughter. Love with heart. Cause thats all that matters in the end. ","Getting divorced just because you dont love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do. ","It is not likely that posterity will fall in love with us, but not impossible that it may respect or sympathize; so a man would rather leave behind him the portrait of his spirit than a portrait of his face. ","Love is never defeated, and I could add, the history of Ireland proves it. ","He who knows no hardships will know no hardihood. He who faces no calamity will need no courage. Mysterious though it is, the characteristics in human nature which we love best grow in a soil with a strong mixture of troubles. ","The motto of chivalry is also the motto of wisdom; to serve all, but love only one. ","I love chicken. I would eat chicken fingers on Thanksgiving if it were socially acceptable.

","I happen to be really a romantic. ","We must not, however, be like the leaders of the great romantic revolt who, in their eagerness to get rid of the husk of convention, disregarded also the humane aspiration. ","When I started dating I had this kind of Romeo and Juliet, fateful romantic idea about love which was almost that you were a victim and there was a lot of pain involved and that was how it should be. ","Romantic lovers require from each other at least the facade of reason: We desire to be what romantic love makes us appear in the others eyes. We want to imagine we are deserving of the love we inspire. ","But no, I dont really like romantic comedies, so I dont really care. I never go see em. ","Acting can be pretty challenging.

I feel almost embarrassed revealing this, because the genre has been so degraded in the past twenty years that saying you like romantic comedies is essentially an admission of mild stupidity. ","I had these kind of unrealistic expectations that were fueled by romantic comedies, and it has both helped me and hurt me in many ways. It helped me because, in general, theyve made me hopeful. I just figure things will eventually work out for me. But nobody is like any Tom Hanks character. Nobody is Hugh Grant. No one is Meg Ryan! ","Woody Allen is really the ultimate. I love that he believed in himself enough to do what he did. And I have that same feeling - that theres nobody that looks like me in movies, nobody would cast me as a romantic lead, but I want to do it and I feel confident that I can.

Its very romantic in that way, but a bit naive. I like to play with that in my work. ","The dark comedies tend to be in a non-releasable area. There can be romantic comedies. There can be dramas. But theres no dark comedy inbox for the advertising. ","Im a big romantic, traditional, cheesy guy.

Ive discovered as Ive grown up that life is far more complicated than you think it is when youre a kid. It isnt just a straightforward fairytale. ","I confess I am a romantic. I love romance, and I think its really fun and delicious and some of my favorite films are love stories. I think that you just get a chance to fall in love with the characters so much and you get to explore their lives so deeply. ","I love romantic comedies. Theyre for me the easiest thing to do and the most natural to do. Theres nothing natural about holding an uzi hanging out of a moving van shooting at people. Thats not second nature to me, thank God.

","The Southern whites are in many respects a great people. Looked at from a certain point of view, they are picturesque. If one will put oneself in a romantic frame of mind, one can admire their notions of chivalry and bravery and justice. ","In mainstream romantic comedies, Im usually tearing my hair out. Its just a devastatingly difficult genre for me. ","Sometimes I make very selfish choices; like I did Once Upon A Time for my inner 8-year-old and my hypothetical future child. Ive done some movies because I would regret them if I didnt, but other projects Ive done because theyve scared me or if I felt I needed to do a big romantic comedy to help me professionally.

I cant sit still. ","I broke my nose in gym when a ball hit me. I took a girl to her debutante ball the next week wearing a tux and a big, honking bandage. Not the romantic night she had in mind. ","So many women today have become so focused on their children, theyve developed these romantic entanglements with their childrens lives, and the husbands are secondary. Theyre left out. And the romantic focus is on the children. ","I would have loved to do Alice in Wonderland. Being a Bond girl would always be fun. We had a lot of action in Eclipse and Id definitely like to continue down the action road. I want to do a romantic period piece, but those are really hard to get made because theyre very expensive and theres not a huge demographic. ","Acting is not about anything romantic, not even fantasy, although you do create fantasy.

Coleridge might last two days and cover 145km. ","My vanity is Im terribly romantic! But being married is lovely. ","There is as much wisdom in listening as there is in speaking - and that goes for all relationships, not just romantic ones. ","I lived by the candlelight for two years because I couldnt afford power. It was nice and romantic at the time, but if you cant afford power youre pretty broke. You endure it.

","I think that the romantic impulse is in all of us and that sometimes we live it for a short time, but its not part of a sensible way of living. Its a heroic path and it generally ends dangerously. I treasure it in the sense that I believe its a path of great courage. It can also be the path of the foolhardy and the compulsive. ","Its been such a deep and amazing journey for me, getting close to John Keats, and also I love Shelley and Byron. I mean, the thing about the Romantic poets is that theyve got the epitaph of romantic posthumously. They all died really young, and Keats, the youngest of them all. ","I go to Saint Barth in the French West Indies for two weeks each year. That place is amazing. Amazing people, beautiful beaches, great wine, wonderful harbors... Its incredibly romantic. ","I dont know if its possible to live the rock n roll lifestyle and still be romantic. ","And I dont believe that children are innocent. In fact, no one seriously believes that. Just go to a playground and watch the kids playing in the sandbox! The romantic notion of the sweet child is simply the parents projecting their own wishes. ","Its easier to write from my own life, and its also more fun. I always write about relationships, for instance, whether theyre romantic relationships, friendships, encounters... theres always a lesson to be learned from them. ","I used to be a hopeless romantic - I fell in love with everyone I went out with. ","My great-grandfather was in the army in India, and we have photographs of my family there in full Victorian dress. Theyre incredibly romantic.

","I love romantic comedies, or romantic dramas - basically anything with love in it. ","My music is bejewelled, its colourful, its romantic, it shines. ","I hope that I would be considered romantic.

Its about connecting with the person and being able to talk and share things with her. ","If I were given a choice between two films and one was dark and explored depraved, troubled or sick aspects of our culture, I would always opt for that over the next romantic comedy. ","I think opera has gained a kind of glamorous appeal. Its a live performance that aligns all of the arts, and when it is represented in the media, in film in particular, it is presented as something that is really a special event, whether its a great date or something thats just hugely romantic. ","Im better with my hands, and I always loved the slightly romantic idea of starting with bits of wood and being able to create something to sit on, to eat from, to store your clothes in.

You have to live there once without any money, and then you have to live there when you have money. Let me tell you, of the two, the latter is far better. ","Vampires are so old that they dont need to impress anyone anymore. Theyre comfortable in their own skin. Its this enigmatic strength thats very romantic and old-fashioned. I think it goes back to something of a Victorian attitude of finding a strong man whos going to look after his woman. ","But romantic vision can also lead one away from certain very hard, ugly truths about life that are important to know. ","In those days, boxing was very glamorous and romantic. You listened to fights on the radio, and a good announcer made it seem like a contest between gladiators. ","I dont want to be Mr. Romantic Leading Man. I dont want to be the Dance Dude. I dont want to be the Action Guy. If I had to do any one of those all my life, itd drive me crazy. ","The most aggressive artists often hide their romantic side.

","For a romantic comedy to be three hours long, thats longer than most marriages. ","Is that romantic fantasy real? Um, after kids, no. Take the kids away, I dont know. Depends.

","It seemed romantic but also tragic - people would be winning but then lose it all, or crash but fight on, break bones but get back on their bikes and try to finish. Just getting to the end was seen as an achievement in itself. ","I guess Im a bit of a romantic.

Id have some romantic scenes as Audrey Hepburn and have gritty black-and-white scenes as Patricia Neal. ","Then I abandoned comics for fine art because I had some romantic vision of being like Vincent Van Gogh Jr. ","Being in the studio is a really romantic time.

So, I just keep my private life to myself. ","Well, theres just some universal truths in a way that Ive just observed to be true. You read Voltaire. You read modern literature. Anywhere you go, theres these observations about romantic love and what it does people, and these rotten feelings that rarely are people meaning to do that to each other.

I just feel like all I do is cry, sob, and fight zombies and the bad guys. ","I try to do romantic gestures all the time. ","No, actually The Host was totally a palate-cleanser for me.

They used to be well-received but that was before she started studying Shakespeare at drama college. Now I feel so inept. ","We have got too many kids around the house to have a romantic meal at home. But Danielle is a fantastic cook. She does a brilliant lasagne, great roasts and a great chilli dish. She knows the way to my heart. ","I never got the opportunity to be romantic or feel romantic with anyone.

","I dont want to do romantic roles where I have to lip sync to a song. A role that explores romance on a new level would suit me. ","Times were changing. Clothes were changing. Morals were changing. We went from romantic loves songs like I used to do to rock n roll. Now that has changed to rap. So, theres always a new generation with new music. ","We are in desperate need of a well-done romantic lesbian comedy. ","I am a big fan of the old Howard Hawks films from the 30s and 40s, I was a big Hepburn and Tracey fan for a while and Woody Allen films that are a very different kind of romantic comedy. ","Youre always close and you never get that big romantic lead. ","Movies dont look hard, but figuring it out, getting the shape of it, getting everybodys character right and having it be funny, make sense and be romantic, its creating a puzzle. Yes, having been a writer for so long, I have an awareness of when things are going awry, but it doesnt mean I know how to fix them. ","Im a very romantic person. ","I have never been so calculating as to sing some Barry White song to get a girl. But I do think its very romantic to cook dinner and sit around the piano at night and sing together. ","If we perform the romantic repertoire we need more musicians. ","Classical, Romantic, and Baroque music, thats what I really like. ","Im a really huge fan of the old romantic comedies from the 30s and 40s... Huge fan. I love all that stuff. ","As an actor, Ive grown considerably. Its taken me years to get comfortable doing a romantic scene and dancing on stage in front of a live audience. Ive really opened up a lot. ","My husband does so many romantic things for me, its absurd. ","Boys have said in the past that I live my life like a movie. I love all things romantic, like kissing in the rain. ","When I read the script, I liked the script very much and I thought it was a marvelous part for her, because I think it is a change of pace. I mean, we know how wonderful she is in romantic comedy. ","I am a romantic, I admit it. ","I dont know if its a romantic comedy but Im in the beginning of the first of the season of The West Wing. We shot it last year. I dont know. If anyone asks me to be in one, Ill jump on it. ","When I start to write, words have become physical presence. It was to see if I could bring that private world to life that found its first expression through reading. I really dislike the romantic notion of the artist. ","You do your work as a photographer and everything becomes past. Words are more like thoughts; the photographers picture is always surrounded by a kind of romantic glamor - no matter what you do, and how you twist it. ","Women love romance, but theyre not as romantic as men. ","Im not a big fan of romantic comedies, believe it or not. ","In real love you want the other persons good. In romantic love, you want the other person. ","When I was younger, many of my romantic escapades were just a means of simply avoiding being by myself. I was afraid of feeling lonely, afraid I wouldnt know what to say to myself. ","I was also the romantic lead in The Boston Strangler - I was the only one that lived to tell the story - so I called myself the romantic lead. ","Hugh Grant is the main man. Hes the number one romantic comedy man in the world. ","Im a horrible romantic! ","Before I became a suspense novelist, I wrote romantic suspense as Alicia Scott. ","I was the female lead in a romantic comedy. Its a little indie film that we shot in China called America Town, starring Daniel Henney and Bill Paxton. I actually had to speak Chinese in the film. It was funny because I found out I was doing the film and then a week later, I was in Shanghai. ","People want to hear about the extremes of human nature. They want things that are larger than their own lives, and more romantic, and not necessarily of their own experiences. ","If its a romantic holiday, the only thing I need is my wife. We love quiet and calm places where we cant be disturbed. Neither of us likes being in busy places; we would much rather stay in our hotel room and enjoy each others company. ","I Am Number Four is an action-packed adventure entwined with a romantic story. I play the role of John Smith. John wants to be a normal kid, but he is from a different planet and he has been given this destiny of becoming a warrior. ","As far as the leading man/romantic lead, Ill tell you what, I really enjoyed my experience more than I thought or imagined I would on Catch and Release. God bless them if they want to give me another shot at that. I would love to have that as something I can go to on occasion. ","I would like to do maybe a smaller romantic comedy. ","You wont find me in a romantic comedy. Those movies dont speak to me. People dont come to talk to me about those scripts, because they probably think Im this dark, twisted, miserable person. ","The thing you cant let go of is gravity. The reality of gravity in writing. If someone says something really mean in a sitcom, and the next wave isnt a reaction to the reality of that, you start losing relatability. In a lot of romantic comedies, they throw out the rules of life. ","Building a little bonfire at night on the beach and lying on a blanket with my wife under the stars is not only sexy, its romantic. ","The big stars I felt a kinship with were never the romantic leads. It wasnt Steve McQueen or Robert Redford - it was people like Walter Matthau and Anthony Quinn. My big hero was Tommy Cooper. ","I would love to write a mystery - a romantic, funny mystery. ","I love romantic comedy, but I think you have to have another idea that youre chasing along with romantic comedy. ","If I were sufficiently romantic I suppose Id have killed myself long ago just to make people talk about me. I havent even got the conviction to make a successful drunkard. ","The idea of being a novelist is really romantic, but its kind of the same as being president of the United States - its not gonna happen. ","There are so many different reasons as to why I love riding trains. But I think ultimately its the romantic feeling of it. Theres something about it that just transports me into old films. ","Im opening up my heart to the idea of dating. Its funny - my friends would always come to me for romantic advice. I know nothing, and things have changed since I was dating in high school! Im really trying hard to spend this time working on myself. ","When I was a teenager I was a total romantic escapist. My world was books. ","I think in a lot of romantic comedies it ends with a kiss, and I feel like in modern day relationships, and maybe just my own experience, it starts with a kiss and then all sort of falls apart and then comes together. Youre texting. Youre wondering whats going on. Theres no definitions, theres no labels. ","I try to speak of a love that not necessarily romantic. I think there is so much love between people and so much love people want to give but its harder and harder these days to show that, to celebrate that, you know? ","Maybe Im naively romantic, but I do believe that spice and excitement doesnt stop once a couple gets together. ","Although some people think I am a romantic novelist I have always thought of myself as a rather gritty radical historian. ","I got a degree in sociology, didnt read much fiction in college, and I was a pretty political, left-wing type of guy. I wanted to do some kind of work in social change and make things better for the poor man, and I was very romantic and passionate about it. ","I want to do more action adventures and more romantic comedies. ","Somebody called me a bruised romantic once, and I like that. ","I dont live with people, thats why my relationships last. Im not romantic. Even when I was a teenager if somebody asked if they could hold my hand Id say, - no, its not heavy, I can hold it myself, thank you. ","Romantic music really stirs my soul. And, of course, I love Chinese music; it makes me feel closer to home. ","Im a very romantic and passionate guy. ","But other vampire stories? Well, no, I really havent read too many, and I cant say Im crazy about romantic vampires anyway - to me the vampire is simply an evil monster. ","Im a hopeless romantic, and very much the person in a relationship to go: If things are going well, Ill buy the flowers, remember the dates of things, plan fun nights out. ","Something like Without a Paddle does really well at the box office and Im like, Oh, here we go. In Without a Paddle Im the romantic lead - great! A comedy and thats what America wants. Then it did nothing for me and I went into kind-of a work abyss. I just didnt get another shot. ","I had to trick people into giving me money for my first film. Making a romantic comedy is easier and more expected from a woman than it is to make a drama about a Japanese warrior. ","At the risk of sounding hopelessly romantic, love is the key element. I really love to play with different musicians who come from different cultural backgrounds. ","I heard this music coming out of the radio and it was Aint Nobodys Business. It got me. I thought, I can do this. I decided just like that. No romantic story. ","I love romantic comedies. ","I think Bach is equally a romantic composer because he laid the seeds harmonically for people like Chopin and the great Romantics, Brahms, so its difficult to you know all this like labelling and putting - I think Bach is attractive to musicians because he supersedes the labels. ","What Romantic terminology called genius or talent or inspiration is nothing other than finding the right road empirically, following ones nose, taking shortcuts. ","A mans ability to haggle is never a turn-on. The only thing less romantic than how much you paid is how much you saved. The last thing we want to hear is how you talked the jeweler down on our new earrings. ","After these three novels I gave up writing novels for a time; I was dissatisfied with romantic doom, yet didnt see much way around it. ","Theres a hardening of the culture. Reality TV has lowered the standards of entertainment. Youre left wondering about the legitimacy of relationships. Its probably harder to entertain the same people with a more classic form of writing, and romantic comedies are a classic genre. ","I am not an adolescent, nor a romantic. I analyze objectively. ","Many people with physical disabilities have romantic lives and good marriages to partners who see past their disabilities and recognize all of the things they can do. ","I think Bond the character is distinct: Hes British, he has a certain code that he lives by, hes incorruptible... hes a classical hero, but hes also fallible. He has inner demons, inner conflicts, and hes a romantic. ","With While You Were Sleeping, it was so much fun and such a Cinderella story, that I didnt want to do another romantic comedy. I wanted to do the opposite. ","Truthfully, I almost avoided While You Were Sleeping, because I find those romantic comedies kind of precious, and theyre full of lines that leave you feeling a little bewildered when you say them. ","Im getting a lot of uninteresting romantic lead guys that look good and fall in love sort of garbage. ","Its harder and harder to make a well-done romantic comedy these days because the conventions have been so played out. ","The first book I wrote was The Bride Price which was a romantic book, but my husband burnt the book when he saw it. I was the typical African woman, Id done this privately, I wanted him to look at it, approve it and he said he wouldnt read it. ","In the West, audiences think I am a stereotyped action star, or that I always play hitmen or killers. But in Hong Kong, I did a lot of comedy, many dramatic films, and most of all, romantic roles, lots of love stories. I was like a romance novel hero. ","Im no romantic, surfing, California boy. I like reading, writing, philosophizing. Scheming. Ive been doing some exploration of the inner space. ","I know its hard to blame the time, but theres a bit of an expectation for a summer movie. I think that Superman Returns was a bit nostalgic and romantic, and I dont think that was what people were expecting, especially in the summer. ","Forget romantic fiction, a survey has found that most women would rather read a good book than go shopping, have sex, or sleep. ","People say the Lost Generation in a romantic sense, but I think it was tragic. They were really lost. ","I think a nice romantic dinner should be saved for when you and the girl youre dating or seeing have something special and its a more special occasion. ","I love it when a man cooks; its one of those points that makes me adore a guy. I think its so romantic and I feel cared for when a man cooks. ","It seems to me that romantic comedies used to be about falling in love, but in recent years theyve really become just comedies where the love story is only there as a spine to hang the jokes on. ","Scotsmen are metaphisical and emotional, they are sceptical and mystical, they are romantic and ironic, they are cruel and tender, and full of mirth and despair. ","The writing career is not a romantic one. The writers life may be colorful, but his work itself is rather drab. ","There were two sides to David Lean: on the one side, he was kind of a rather stiff, disciplined Englishman. And then he had this kind of romantic side to him. I think being true to both sides of your nature is important. ","I dont make romantic films. I make films about human relationships. ","I get some of my ideas from watching my three daughters, but most of them come from my own memories of growing up. I can remember how romantic I was, not just about love, but romance in the classic sense - the romantic ideals: of honor and truth, of loyalty, sacrifice and fairness. Those were the elements that made a story satisfying to me. ","The thing about romance and romantic movies is that they can be somewhat melodramatic. For a lot of actors, theres a certain cringe factor thats involved with that. ","A realist, in Venice, would become a romantic by mere faithfulness to what he saw before him. ","In our romantic groves I adored her like a divinity. ","Consider what a romantic expedition you are on; take notes. ","So Im still in my romantic stage with London, I love it as a place. ","I think one of the downsides of the sort of obsession with romantic love and personal fulfillment is that the plain fact of the matter is that those feelings dont last for ever and so they better be replaced and reinforced by things that do. ","You can tell a lot about a man from his hands. If they dont have any scars or calluses on them, you might as well assume they cry at romantic comedy films, too. ","The whole westward expansion myth is seen as romantic. But its a joke, a blot on American history. ","I want to do all kinds of things. I want to do some comedy. Id love to do a romantic comedy, and Id love to do some period pieces with classical text. Id love somebody to cast me as Macbeth, but for a film. I just want to be all over the place. "};
